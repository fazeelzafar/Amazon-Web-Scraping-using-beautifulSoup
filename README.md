# Amazon-Web-Scraping-using-beautifulSoup

This was a project that was assigned to me during my 6th Semester course "Introduction to Data Science".
I had to pick a product type from Amazon and extract reviews of each item in that product catergory and save those reviews in .xlsx and .csv files.

The files with extracted reviews can be used later for EDA and to predict how many reviews in the files are positive and negative
