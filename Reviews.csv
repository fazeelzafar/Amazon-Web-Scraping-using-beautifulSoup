For 25$ you get the performance of AirPods and they don’t look like a cheap knockoff, they look slick not bulky at all.

I don't normally do reviews of items, but I felt like giving my honest opinions on these.they are close in size to the Galexy buds by Samsung (yes- i misspelled galexy in the picture, please bear with me- I was sleepy.)but the shape mimics apples airpods. (sort of.)from the picture you can tell they have a flat back to them, and are a bit longer than standard airpods, though neither of these details bother me- as I bought these for their budget friendly pricing, and that niche desire for black airpods without paying a fortune for custom painting or trying my hand at doing it myself.the earbuds themselves are a glossy black- while the case is a matte black plastic, the lid lip is a bit difficult to open, but not enough to be noticable, and the bump in the middle is a pairing button used to hold down- where an LED will let you know by flashing white, that it is in pairing mode.However, I would say the main detail I feel is important to highlight here though, is the sound quality.now- its nothing special. The highs and mids are acceptable, they sound very open but not 'tinny', the bass is, well- there isn't very much bass sadly, and when your volume is all the way up, you can hear audio leaking from them, but overall- for the price, i would say they are worth it.now I haven't seen just how long these can run for, but as far as I can tell, they should be fine for extended periods of listening to music, and I've done my best to Not get them wet. I wouldn't try to use them in the shower, but maybe that is just me being a bit too cautious.my only gripe- is the lack of options to customize the imput for the devices.There is not an interface to change the tap input, so if that is somehow a deal breaker for you- there are other, albeit probably more expensive, options out there for you to try.I would recommend these to people looking to save their money, to listen to music while studying, to android users as I don't know how well they play with apple, and to people who want a plug and play experience.Hope this helps anyone looking for details in the future.

I've bought 3 pairs of these now. Each one broke after about 5 months. At first I thought it was a one-off, but now I realize it's a pattern. I bought these as inexpensive earbuds for the gym since I didn't want to ruin my airpods. But at this point, it'll be more cost-effective in the long-run to buy a separate set of airpods to use at the gym. Wanted to love these, but can't justify the poor quality.

Came back to double-check if they were waterproof (apparently they are, I will make sure to personally check that in a bit) and just decided to write a review since I'm already here.These earbuds aren't bad, life lasts a while although I have started to notice their battery expectancy is slowly decreasing but eh, I'm not going to die.A con I didn't really notice until having them is not being able to tell their battery percentage. Tad annoying, but I'll live.Oh! When they are dying and you hear the lady speaking, it barely gives you more than a minute or so to actually do something. They tend to shut down very fast after that.Hope this helps, even if a bit. Have a good day!

Updated Post: I received a replacement that came with additional instructions aside from the booklet instructions that comes with the earbuds. I was able to connect these earbuds with no issue after following the instructions from the piece of paper that was included. These instructions are a little different from the booklet instructions. I concluded that I did not remove the film from the initial earbuds that was sent. I do not recall the booklet instructions mentioning this. So if you’re having pairing issues please remove the film before trying to pair. I will include a picture of the instructions that was included with the replacement earbuds that was sent.Original Post: Tried pairing these earbuds with five different  devices(4 phones & 1 Android), but neither picked up this device. I wanted these to work so bad even after reading reviews of issues with pairing. This was such a disappointment.  I ordered a replacement, because I like the look of these(reason for the additional star) and also because the cost of earbuds have gone back to its original price since Black Friday weekend/Cyber Monday have passed. Hopefully they test the replacement before shipping it to me.

I wanted to wait before leaving a review. I've had these ear buds for a little over a month. Had to play around with them for about 10 minutes to get them to connect to my cheap android phone.They sound really good and have good bass, no complaints there.Despite being the hard plastic, they are still comfortable (my ears are on the smaller side).I use them nearly every day (for about 2 hrs average) and only need to charge about once a week . Charging the case takes a couple hours. After that, simply returning the buds to the case will charge them.I noticed after a few weeks that your phone will tell you the buds battery percentage of you pull down the drop down menu and look at your Bluetooth icon. I think that's helpful .The only issue I've had is with them not connecting right away when taking them out the case. But maybe the battery was low at that moment, not sure.In conclusion, I am happy with my purchase. I searched for so long before buying these.

Full disclosure these are my only BT ear buds so I have nothing to compare them to. They work well for my purposes. Phone calls are clear and people seem to hear me fine. Watching TV and movies on my phone sounds ok. The sound quality when listening to music is not that great. The range is terrible but for the money it does the job and I got used to it. The music is clear but flat no low range. Rock sounds ok but anything with bass sounds funny to me. But like I said for the money they work great. I mostly listen to podcast so no issues. Charging is quick when they run low. They seem to last 4-5 hours between charges depending on what ur doing. Range to me is just ok. I thought New BT range was supposed to be longer. I’d guess I get less than 30ft maybe 20ft. I gave 4 stars because for the cost these are a good deal. If the sound quality for music was a little better I’d give 5 stars.

So these are pretty cheap, and if you are like me, you go to the reviews to see if the product is good or not. And let me just say that these earbuds are perfectly priced. They have the feel of air pods (I'll let you decide if that's good or not) and have the sound quality of an average pair of earbuds. The noise cancelation isn't amazing, but these earbuds can get pretty loud so even if you are mowing the lawn you can still listen to your music with little to no problem. The battery life on mine is insane as well. I  bought them last march or so and at the time of writing this ad, I have used them almost everyday...and charged them like a total of 4 times. So for the low price of these, I really don't think they can be beat. Also, I recently was wearing them while washing dishes at work and the right earbud fell into a sink full of water, fully submerged, and yet when I pulled it out it was still playing music like nothing ever happened. 100% would recommend if you need a cheap pair of burner earbuds.

I normally never do reviews, but dude, I have tried so many wireless earbuds and somehow they don’t work  something. Actually just bought different ones at a store 2 weeks ago mad I can’t find receipt to return them. Finally I see these, the sound is great! They fit perfectly, not going in and out like the others. Perfect size just love them, and I like that I can change the songs without my phone just touch the side 2 seconds and it changes the song and works to go to the previous song as well. My only complaint and it’s not even bad. I’m used to be able to see if my ear phones are dying from the case with the blinking light on the outside of the case. This one is on the inside so I have to open the case to see if it’s charged. (Just got them in the mail today so maybe I can leave the case open?, the manual didn’t say) but yes, these are worth the buy!

I really liked these, sound was good and the mic worked well, they paired easily, and had really solid battery life.  Sadly, the left headphone broke after about 5 months.  I guess I got my money's worth, I used them a lot during that time and they were good while they worked, but I'm still disappointed to have to replace them so soon.

UPDATE:I’m still loving these 2 months later. I use these for my workouts, and sweat profusely.The microphone is better than average.Sound is good and you can use them one a time if you want to.These are easy to charge and can be saved to two devices simultaneously, however only one connection at a time.My original review had 30 likes and wanted to update my review.Also this should have a higher star rating based price and performance.ORIGINAL:I have the Airpods 2, however I can't use them for working out, as I sweat a lot and have been damaging the charging connection on the bottom of them. I do however, find the Airpod design comfortable in my ears and have been looking for some that I could use for working out. These headphones fit the bill. I was worried as some of the reviews were not 'verified purchases', however these are great. It has a strong sound base, and you don't have to turn it up all the way to get good sound (as is the case with many TWS).If the Airpods or Apple EarPods fit you well, these fit similarly.There is no lag/latency with online videos or streaming movies.The microphone is actually pretty good too (although I've only tried it on my iPhone 11's voice recorder).This is an incredible value set of Apple Airpod like headphones.This includes USB-C charging, small pocketable case and stylish headphones.Very impressed and glad I got these; I've tried too many others.Thanks.

I always look for cheaper bluetooth earbuds because I'm going to lose one at some point.  This set is great but has shorter battery life in the earbuds themselves than other models I've had. Luckily, I only ever use 1 at a time, so I simply have to alternate them every 3-4 hours.  At 8 hours of use per day, I can usually get a few days worth of charging from the case.  Super comfortable as well.

Bro these are mf amazing, for the price?? Its so good I had them for like 6 months just lost them smh and rn I just bought another pair, in all that time I dropped them so many time and all type of stuff and they stayed working perfectly fine, the battery life it’s literally insane, id just use them to workout and thats it tho like 1 and a half hours so idk how it would be for all day use but i would go hella days and maybe weeks without charging it, now sound it aint gon be crazy dont expect crazy for this price but yeah man these are like legit the best u could get for this price on my opinion. OHH LMAO AND THEY MAGNETIC TOO id stick them to stuff so cool. Just get them u wont be disappointed.

Sometimes you buy relatively cheap headphones thinking “well if they’re shit at least I didn’t waste too much money” AND THEN YOU GET THESE. These MFs got CHEWED ON by my puppy and they STILL WORK! And they work just as well!! Also I bought these headphones in March and so far I haven’t had to charge them??? Like??? So rad. 10/10

They changed the design on them!!! Originally used to just slip in the ear. Now they are bulky and have protruding rubber old school knobs that go in your ear. So uncomfortable. Used to love these and now I'm returning them and looking for a pair that was similar to the original

I have enjoyed using these earbuds. However sometimes they tend to slip out of my ear. I think this is a common issue that people have with this particular product but overall it's pretty good. I don't see myself doing heavy exercise/dynamic exercises while using this particular product very much. However if you're doing a task it doesn't require you to lower and/or raise your head quickly they're fine. Besides the question will touch features that work when they want to and my experience this product has a good bang for his buck.

As far as the quality of sound & noise cancellation go, I think these are great! The thing I am not happy with is that they go out a lot.  The left ear seems to loose connection a lot even though they still have a decent charge. Also what I don't like about these is there is no where to adjust the volume. I cannot find any button on these to adjust. Maybe I am missing something here because I would assume there has to be a way to adjust the volume. I kept them because I got a great deal on them but if you have to pay full price, I would keep looking.

In general i really like the earbuds, they can connect with android or iPhone, battery life in operation more than 2 hours in high volume, and pretty much all the day or more if it connected but not used. The charging is fast too.The only thing that's frustrates me is when i connect them, sometimes I've the left works only, and the other times the right earbud works, I've to put them in their charger, disconnect the bluetooth then connect again, this is happens frequently, other than that i really like the product.

I like to fall asleep to audiobooks so I needed an inexpensive pair of ear buds for sleeping.  I do not like headphones that ""suction"" into your ears and I prefer the shape of Apple's wired ear buds.  I didn't want to spend the money on AirPods, though.  These are the perfect compromise.  They do not have the greatest sound quality, but are just fine for audiobooks.  They are comfortable in my ears and do not fall out when I am sleeping.  My only complaint would be that if the battery of the headphones starts to get low during the night, the ""Battery low, please charge now"" message is loud and always wakes me up.  I would prefer more of a beep alert, but it is what it is.
"

These earbuds are kind of ""Ok"". Here's a list of pros and cons:Pros- The BEST thing about these earbuds is the fact that they activate on a double-tap, not on a single tap like all other Bluetooth earbuds. This was great for me because whenever I re-adjust the earbuds in my ears, or take my sweatshirt off they don't stop playing due to an accidental tap. A MASSIVE plus for me.- They are not in-ear, they are earbuds so they gently, but firmly, sit in the ear.- They do not fall off the ear during workouts.- Very comfortable.- They look nice and slick.- Lasting battery, no issues during 1:30h workouts.- Small carrying case.- USB-C charging, which means they charge a lot faster than with a mini-USB port.- Low price.Con- The sound quality is absolutely horrendous. There is absolutely zero bass in these earbuds. The music sounds like coming from inside a can of tomatoes, lol.The above con was the dealbreaker for me. I had to return them.If you want earbuds with all the pros mentioned above minus de con, get the TBI Pro Airpro. Those are a bit more expensive but the sound of those earbuds is no less than epic, to put it mildly: unmatched bass and excellent balance with brights (treble).

Left ear bud will BLAST static if you touch it in the wrong spot. This happens when you adjust the ear bud in your ear or even take it out. I already returned the first pair due to this issue and now my current pair is having this issue. Definitely would suggest that you test the left ear bud before the return window closes!!!
"
34,"
I love them. It is hard to find earbuds that fit my ears and these were perfect. They are easy to charge and easy to carry around. I wish that my left earbud still worked properly. I bought them towards the end of March 2021 and by June the bud malfunctioned. I can still hear out of it but I would have to turn the volume to maximum which then hurts my right ear, obviously. I can only use my left or my right at one time.I am not a fan of needing to push the bud into my ear If it happens to slip..because it has touch sensors that I am not utilizing so I didn't  read up on what those do exactly. I know, I'm bad! But those are my gripes.

I love these headphones. After going through two pairs of AirPods in two years (both of them mysteriously died on me), I didn’t want to throw away a few hundred bucks for a third time, but I really loved the convenience of the AirPod. Having been scorned by dupes a few times in the past I was skeptical about these, but now 4 months into 1-5 hours of daily use (and use in the shower) and they’ve been great and are going strong. Honestly even if they died now I’d rebuy for the price. My only complaint is that they’re sometimes glitchy when they get super wet but really it’s no big deal. I definitely recommend.

I bought a pair of 1st generation ipods about 1 year and a half ago. I didn't realize they were already outdated when I got them from Bestbuy. I paid around $125. I had problems with one ear pod not working for the entire year I owned them and now a year and half later, I can't charge them. So I tried out the ear pods instead. So far, they work great. The battery life is superior to Apple and the sound quality is good. There is slightly less bass compared to Ipods but it doesn't bother me and I am a professional musician. Save the $100 bucks and get these instead of Apple Ipods, that's my advice.

I love these items.  Headphones with the silicon earbud never fit properly and it was a relief to find a product that securely fits comfortably in my ear.  The sound and microphone quality are both good, especially for something so reasonably priced.  One warning: Be sure to remove the small pieces of tape from the ends of the earpieces before you try to pair them.  I kept them on, wanting to test them before I decided if I was going to keep them.  It caused endless problems until I saw another reviewer here say ""take the plastic fully off"" and then they worked effortlessly.  Great product.

I wanted a pair of ear buds I could use when I go walking.  I needed an inexpensive product so I wouldn't be horrified if I lost one.  These buds deliver adequate performance, are easy for a senior citizen like me to use, and are convenient to carry around in their case.  The stay charged long enough for my uses.  I mainly listen to voice in podcasts and audio books.  If you have strong musical preferences and are very sensitive to musical sound quality, you should check out reviews that cover this topic.  I am very satisfied with these ear buds and would buy them again.

Pretty disappointing, the battery doesn’t last as long as I expected it to, and while it works well for music, I have issues almost everytime I’m on a MS teams or phone call :/Update, after two months the sound is all jacked up and I will need to buy new headphones….. 8/10 would NOT recommend
"

For the money, these are great! The sound is good and they are comfortable. I'm only two complaints are the mic is very quite, many people on calls have a hard time hearing me and the ""charging/battery life indicator"" doesn't really make sense, so there's some guess work on keeping them charged.
"

These headphones are actually very nice, I was a bit skeptical at first but as soon as i tried them on they were very amazing. But there were a few problems regarding different apps making the sound quality bad. When i went on a piano app, the quality became very bad and It was sad. If i went to any app regarding making your own music, MusicStudio, Magic piano, the sound quality just became really bad, idk why thoe. But everything else is normal.
"

I've had these on hand for a few months now and they're not that bad. The sound quality is decent; although I wish the bass would have been better, you shouldn't expect much from on ear earbuds like these. However, I find that its battery life is great (maybe 1 full charge a week or two) and the functionality is pretty good. These earbuds are a nice fit and won't come off during a workout.
"
46,"
These worked out so well for the last months that I decided to get a second pair.I work outside all day and I can say my first pair functions like brand new. The reason I got two is so I can switch back and forth when ones charging I use the other. The battery life is about 3-4 hours consistently.I’ve been able to pair them with anything with Bluetooth without a problem. My iPhone. Laptop. Pc. Smart watch. TV. Car. No problems at all pairing.The only thing I wish it had was a battery level indicator but other than that, a lot of bang for the buck.
"
47,"
Sound quality is really awesome and the range covers a pretty good distance away from the phone.It's just my ears probably, but whenever I laugh or smile these ear buds fall out. They don't stay on that well when working out or having lively conversation.The magnet inside the case is pretty weak so if you drop it they 100% will go flying out of the case.

I bought this product to replace an old wired earbud headset.  The old wire headset had: a mic and a volume control button built-in.Other than using it for phone calls and music, I wasn't able to get much more use out of the product.  So, if you're looking for something that would suit these needs, then I think it's worth it.In addition to the above, I bought this so I can use it for Discord, WebEx, and Zoom meetings.  But the earbuds didn't seem to work well with any of these programs and hardly picked up the mic sensitive despite it being set up all the way.  I think if this was addressed along with an option of adjusting the sound on the earbuds, it would be perfect.
"
49,"
I got these for work when I had to return to the office 2 days a week and needed headphones for calls and video conferences. Only one earbud has worked the entire time I've had them despite troubleshooting the issue. They do hold a charge for a long time, but when you only have one working, it's disappointing. The sound quality is decent.

The headphones has a really nice sound quality, the battery life is really good and they are great to do my workout. The only minor thing is that they get disconnected for a few seconds if the phone is in my pocket making this a little bit annoy but overall, I really like them and for the price, you could not ask for more.

The elephant in the room: sound. They sound amazing for ""cheap"" Bluetooth headphones. Everything else about them was a plus. Battery life is about 3-4 hours which is about right. I'm hard of hearing and I only turn them up to 50% for music. They also fit good. One of my ears had major reconstructive surgery so both sides are shaped differently, and they don't fall out of either side. They work great for jamming out in the shower, touch features can be bothersome when wet but for $30 you can't beat these. Highly recommend

If you're looking for a cheap pair of wireless earbuds, you've come to the right place. I use these daily and have had zero issue with them. Charges up USB-C. 3ish hours charge per ear. I typically wear 1 earbud at a time and keep the other one in the charging case. The earbud will announce that it has a low battery. The magnet in the case is strong and the earbuds fall right into place. All plastic construction with no rubber on the earbud. No issues with sensitive skin on the ear. Purchased in September 2020. Review written January 2021.

It's a great deal for the quality. Sounds are good. I wear at it work for my daily use. I use a printer and scanner with loud noises and I can still hear my podcasts clearly. The only complaint is it does hurt my ear after an hour of wear, so I will switch sides. Making and receiving phone calls are clear as well.

Light weight ear buds, fit my ears better than the rubber tip type. Only con I have is the range of these, if you don't have your device within 6 feet they don't work. Other than that I like them.

These headphones work perfectly.  They are comfortable in my ears and don't fall out with movement.  They connect instantly once the case is opened which prevents me from missing the beginning of conversations while waiting for them to connect. Love these.  The only downside is that they are super sensitive and I have accidentally ended calls while putting them in my ear because if your finger taps the earbuds, it ends the call.  Since learning that, I am super careful when putting them in my ear and I have not had any problems.

Sound quality is good for listening but when I use them for phone calls, people can't hear me very well. Purchased 2 pairs, and they both have the same problem. Other thank that, I like to use them for workouts. They don't fall out of your ear and they even work for my 7 year old.

Obviously what was most important to me and most likely to most people is the sound quality and the battery life for this item both of which I found to be beyond reproach I had to drive several hours on a road trip two days after I received this item I used These earphones the entire time and didn’t have any issues with having to recharge them during the drive and the sound quality I felt was perfect absolutely no complaints

They don't last long and be prepared for a high pitched fuzzy screeching right before the battery dies. Other than that they're fine.

...but otherwise these work well.  My husband and I both had trouble pairing these to our phones/tablets/etc, but once we got them paired, they work great.  I think the pairing issue has to do with the timing of getting the device and the pods to ""scan"" at exactly the same time.  But it also could be because we are not especially tech savvy, as well.

If you're looking for convenient, wireless bluetooth earbuds to take phone calls or listen to news, talk shows, etc you can go with these however, if you want some earbuds to listen to music and you expect a somewhat decent performance steer away from these. Although sound is clear, it completely and absolutely lacks ANY bass or even low mid-range. Just a quick reference for iPhone users ... the regular wired earbuds that come (or used to come) with the iPhone sound a whole lot better than these.

I normally only use the right ear bud when I am at work.. as I need to be able to hear announcements etc...But when at the gym I like to have both.  The left one used to go in and out and now it does not work at all. I tired to pair and unpair like the videos say and it still does not work. I guess you get what you pay for.The sound (in the right ear bud) is perfect and the battery life is great which is why I have it 2 stars.

The apple in ear headphones have been the only in ear headphones that don't hurt my ears. Often would get a tender spot with other in ear ones. These are about (if not the) same size as apple ear pods so if you're looking for that as a factor for blue tooth headphones. Batteries maybe last 4-5 hours for me, longer if I'm not pausing the books I listen to.

I enjoyed the sound quality very much compared to other headphones, the battery life is pretty decent, and they fit in my ears without the irritation of constant readjusting (which is hard to find).  However, the right ear bud is defective and stopped working. Purchased 2nd week in February and it stopped working the last week of March. Of course, for the price I did not expect them to last a whole year or anything like that but damn only 6 weeks. It's a pity because I love everything else about them.

This is my first go-round at a pair of wireless earbuds. So far so good. The sound quality is just fine and the size is bearable. They aren't the most comfortable and they tend to fall out from time to time, but I'll take the blame for that and say it's the way my ears are shaped. 🤷🏻‍♀️

I have difficulty pairing, sometimes it works and sometimes not. I can spend forever trying to pair it with a device and will do the same thing a couple of days later and it works fine. Might be unique to my device, but it is annoying. Sound is ok but can be too low at times. However, I have 2 toddlers and a newborn, so who can compete with that?! I would have spent more money on a better quality product.

I have been using these air pods for around 4 months now and I have no complaints.The sound quality is crystal clear, battery life is great and they sit in my ear comfortably even when I am running.Update:Approaching one year of usage and it is still going strong. The only drawback is that I have been told that I sound muffled when I am on a telephone call with someone.

Great for working out! Sound is clear, easy to switch from listening to jams to answering calls. Comfy fit, sleek design and great battery life. Super easy to connect to bluetooth.

Decent pair of headphones for good price. I haven't tested it on a full blast, but they will hold stay on for half of a day with 70% of max volume non stop music. I personally like this type because it hold in the ear just fine and you don't have to constantly fix it when it gets loose. I've used them while mountain skiing and didn't have any problems. Very easy to connect to the phone.

Wonderful earbuds, super comfortable amazing for working out or even just doing chores around the house. The battery life is pretty decent and the sound quality was too notch. They charge really fast too. The only thing I didn't like was how short the charging cord is, but it works with other cords too. I accidentally dropped one in water and it still works like a charm. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.

I've had these earbuds for about 3 to 4 months now probably. At first they worked wonderfully the sound quality was amazing I could get calls and people could hear me I could hear them fine. My mom even accidentally threw one of them in the washer with one of my hoodies and it worked fine after that but one day one of the ears started to get really low even though the volume was up loud as it could go and now if I get a call no one can hear me through these earbuds. Sometimes the signal will drop from the Bluetooth and the music will stop randomly if I'm listening to music and the touch sensors don't totally work anymore. But I guess you get what you pay for there are worth the money for the first couple months but after that they're only good for listening to music for a couple hours.
"

I've had these for about a month and they have worked flawlessly.  The connection has never dropped and they connect quickly when I take them out of the case.  The sound quality for phone calls has been tremendous.  There seems to be no loss of sound quality when compared to holding the headset the old fashion way.  They make phone calls much more convenient.  I don't see any reason to pay more.

At first I was very satisfied with these earbuds- they connected to my laptop and phone relatively easily and I was satisfied with the sound quality, especially considering what I paid for them. However I was not pleased with the battery life- despite charging overnight, many times they would die after a few hours use the very next day.  They also keep randomly dropping bluetooth connection to my devices. At first it was simply one or both earbuds quietly dropping connection, now it has progressed to one or both randomly screeching a very shrill and painful static noise in my ear.  Due to these issues I would not recommend buying these earbuds.

When I paired my device for the first time it showed both earbuds as separate Bluetooth devices on my phone. When I connected to one of them, I would only hear sound out of one ear. When I tried connecting the other device, it switched and I could only hear out of the other ear.I tried disconnecting, powering on off, charging longer and following the troubleshooting steps Amazon has. I’m the end I wasn’t able to resolve the issue so I am returning.Also I wanted to add that plastic on these is pretty cheap. My partner bough a similar pair that was the same price but much nicer. The reason I went for this one was because it has the full plastic earbud rather than the removable tips. But I think I’m going to order the other one instead a after seeing the difference in quality for the same price.
"

Sound quality is clear. The battery last a long time with a full charge. Very easy to pair to Bluetooth.

I would recommend these. Great price and would make a nice gift.

For openers: you need to remove the clear plastic from the earbuds, or they won't charge; that's not mentioned anywhere. The manual itself is written in the language of a really smart auto-translation program, but is oddly phrased at times, to the point where you scratch your head a few times, re-read a sentence a few times, and try to figure out what it really means. (The ""pairing"" section was amazing....). Here's the description of the second (of three) ways to turn off of the earbuds: ""Method 2: earbuds will turn off when they run out of power."" Brilliant! The packaging attempts to mimic the clean, matte white Apple standard, but isn't manufactured to close tolerances; in other words, the box is hard to open. In short, I knew they were inexpensive and figured I'd keep them in my glovebox as a backup. As it stands, I'm just going to toss them.

Returning this item. Here’s my 2 cents:No complains with the sound quality. I only use it with my phone and IPAD.Does not fit properly in my ear. Other people might not face this issue, but I did and it’s not comfortable to wear because there is no cushion. It’s hard plastic.Connects within 10 minutes for the first time and after that within seconds. No issues with that.Main issue and why I am returning is - after it is connected successfully, when I browse the site or video in YouTube or any news channel (just browsing), internet gets disconnected. First I thought it was my IPAD, restarted it and browse the site again, same issue. I turned off Bluetooth, refresh the page and boom everything is working. Connected the earbud again with blue tooth, boom internet is gone. Conclusion, it did not work with my IPAD and with my phone.

I like the fit, finish, charger and size. However I buy 2-3 of these per year as they have a high failure rate. One side either loses volume so it’s uneven, or fails completely.

I guess maybe my expectations were too high based on other reviews? They aren't bad enough for me to return them, but tend to favor other earphones and leave these in the charger. I would probably buy something else if I had it to do over again.

I was disappointed because they were reviewed and rated so well and then when I got them They turned on and off repeatedly every 7 mins.. I troubleshot everyway that was mentioned but nothing changed it..the start up sounds and then the shut down sounds.. repeatedly every 7 mins. They had a great sound but the starting and stopping drove me nuts.

He quedado muy disgustada con la compra de estos auriculares,  es la segunda vez que los compro en menos de un mes y la bocina del lado derecho deja de funcionar, en las dos ocaciones que  hice el pedido tengo el mismo problema, los  primeros auriculares los pedi el 08 de junio y ya el 14 de julio hice otro pedido porque los primeros la bocina derecha dejó de funcionar,el segundo pedido lo realicé el 14 de julio y hoy 10 de agosto la bocina del lado derecho también deja de funcionar, ¿Que hago con los dos auriculares que les he comprado en menos de un mes se han dañado aquí los tengo sin funcionar?El sonido es muy bueno pero la vida útil de las bocinas son pesima

Updated: One of the ear buds stopped working after 6 months of use. The second one stopped a few weeks later.  The title should be changed in ad to: Limited life, disposable ear buds, only good for half a year. Expected way more of a time frame for usage before they stopped working. Poor quality!First review right after purchaseThese are great! I use one ear bud at a time and can recharge in case several times before needing to plug case in. My only wish is that I could tap on ear bud to change volume. You can answer the phone or pause an audible and restart. But the double tap brings up Siri… she could go away.  lol

I purchased these earbuds and found them to be comfortable. But the initial pair I received never fully charged and would stop working after about 30 minutes of playtime. I contacted the seller who sent a replacement, which worked great for a while but after about a month, the left earbud completely stopped working. Actually, thats not totally accurate, because what happened was that I put the left earbud in my ear, as is traditional, and was immediately assaulted with incredibly loud static/feedback that caused me to yelp in such a way that my dog was startled. After that event, the left earbud stopped working entirely. So, I have one earbud that works but it is the right earbud that does not contain the microphone, so I cannot use it for calls.

I had read reviews where it was stated that they fit well for those that have smaller ears, etc. so I bought based on those reviews.  They were too large for me.  The standard IPhone and Samsung ones that are received when you purchase new phones are a good size for me and these were just a little larger and just enough to not work.  I never used or turned on, so not sure about quality.

These earbuds would be great.... If the left side worked.Purchased my first pair, after 2 days of use the left side went into loud static in my ear then completely stopped working, tried the repair and full charge did nothing. Reordered a second pair, again on day 2 of use and same thing happened. Hope the seller/manufacturer finds a way to correct this issue. Again would be great otherwise as sound quality and ear fitment is good for the price.

These earbuds have close to one second of audio delay when I connect them to my Aorus Elite motherboard. This makes games impossible to play. The strange thing about them is if I only connect one earbud then the connection has almost no delay but sounds like I have tin cans to my ear. I got two so I could alternate when one pair dies, but it looks like I'm going to have to return both since they can't do what I needed them to do.Only get these if you plan on using them for music.

Headphones and case are sleek and very nice. Audio is nothing to complain about, but the mic doesn't consistently sound good. Sometimes it's clear and sometimes it it can be very staticky.

They worked well at first. A few months in the left side just stop working. Since I didn't drop them or do anything that would damage them I have to believe that the product is just low quality.

I beyond delighted with these earphones.  In no particular order, here are my thoughts and observations on this product.  I primarily use them for my iPod, listening to books.  I cannot speak to bass or anything to do with the sound for music, but for the spoken word, they are awesome.  They were quite simple to pair with my iPod.  Battery life is exceptional.  I got a solid four hours of listening before they needed to be recharged.  I haven't checked out how many times you can recharge the earphones from one charge of the case.  They stay in my ears and are quite comfortable.  Despite there not being a button to push on the earphones, a tap on either earphone activates a pause or resume on my device.  I haven't tried to use them to make or receive phone calls.  That isn't what I purchased them for.  My only complaint is that each time I want to use them with my iPod, I have to pair them with the device.  It only takes a couple of seconds, so not a great hardship.  The earphones turn themselves off after 10 minutes of no usage.  That saves battery, but restarting my book on the iPod does not reactivate them, I have to pair the two again, and you must have the case in order to do that.  There may be a work around or a solution to this minor issue that I don't know.  The owner's manual is pretty pitiful.  I learned more about the produce off of the Amazon page for the item.  However, I think this is becoming the norm for more and more products.All in all, I am delighted.  For the price, they exceeded my expectations.  Give them a try - I don't think you will be disappointed.

Worked well. Clear sound. Use for phone and podcasts, not music so I cant tell you about that.I'm not a fan of the ""tap"" functionality, preferring a real button with a tactile response, but it works most of the time, when you get used to it.Typical life of one bud is about 2.5 to 3 hours playtime.
"
403,"
These work great and I can walk all around the house with my phone in the other room. My problem is they hurt my ear holes. I can’t wear them very long or use them for running because they fall out.  This is also why I can’t use iPhone earbuds.
"
404,"
Poor sound quality. All treble, no Bass. These were not designed for listening to music. Bass notes were not something that was considered when designing these earbuds. I will say if you are interested in only using them for phone calls, these are comfortable and work well for that.

These are great for the price. Great sound quality. Noise cancelation is pretty decent. The battery life could be better (2-3 hrs) but they recharge pretty fast. All around good for the price.

This is my first pair of earbuds and I am loving them.  I bought them to use at the gym and so far they are working out perfectly.  I am considering buying a second set to keep in my purse since the original pair stays in my gym bag. I crank the music as loud as my phone allows & the clarity is amazing!  They haven't fallen out ever, very pleasantly surprised and the price was right too!

I don't normally do reviews of items, but I felt like giving my honest opinions on these.they are close in size to the Galexy buds by Samsung (yes- i misspelled galexy in the picture, please bear with me- I was sleepy.)but the shape mimics apples airpods. (sort of.)from the picture you can tell they have a flat back to them, and are a bit longer than standard airpods, though neither of these details bother me- as I bought these for their budget friendly pricing, and that niche desire for black airpods without paying a fortune for custom painting or trying my hand at doing it myself.the earbuds themselves are a glossy black- while the case is a matte black plastic, the lid lip is a bit difficult to open, but not enough to be noticable, and the bump in the middle is a pairing button used to hold down- where an LED will let you know by flashing white, that it is in pairing mode.However, I would say the main detail I feel is important to highlight here though, is the sound quality.now- its nothing special. The highs and mids are acceptable, they sound very open but not 'tinny', the bass is, well- there isn't very much bass sadly, and when your volume is all the way up, you can hear audio leaking from them, but overall- for the price, i would say they are worth it.now I haven't seen just how long these can run for, but as far as I can tell, they should be fine for extended periods of listening to music, and I've done my best to Not get them wet. I wouldn't try to use them in the shower, but maybe that is just me being a bit too cautious.my only gripe- is the lack of options to customize the imput for the devices.There is not an interface to change the tap input, so if that is somehow a deal breaker for you- there are other, albeit probably more expensive, options out there for you to try.I would recommend these to people looking to save their money, to listen to music while studying, to android users as I don't know how well they play with apple, and to people who want a plug and play experience.Hope this helps anyone looking for details in the future.

I've bought 3 pairs of these now. Each one broke after about 5 months. At first I thought it was a one-off, but now I realize it's a pattern. I bought these as inexpensive earbuds for the gym since I didn't want to ruin my airpods. But at this point, it'll be more cost-effective in the long-run to buy a separate set of airpods to use at the gym. Wanted to love these, but can't justify the poor quality.

Came back to double-check if they were waterproof (apparently they are, I will make sure to personally check that in a bit) and just decided to write a review since I'm already here.These earbuds aren't bad, life lasts a while although I have started to notice their battery expectancy is slowly decreasing but eh, I'm not going to die.A con I didn't really notice until having them is not being able to tell their battery percentage. Tad annoying, but I'll live.Oh! When they are dying and you hear the lady speaking, it barely gives you more than a minute or so to actually do something. They tend to shut down very fast after that.Hope this helps, even if a bit. Have a good day!

So if you’re having pairing issues please remove the film before trying to pair.

I wanted these to work so bad even after reading reviews of issues with pairing. This was such a disappointment.  I ordered a replacement, because I like the look of these(reason for the additional star) and also because the cost of earbuds have gone back to its original price since Black Friday weekend/Cyber Monday have passed.

I wanted to wait before leaving a review. I've had these ear buds for a little over a month. Had to play around with them for about 10 minutes to get them to connect to my cheap android phone.They sound really good and have good bass, no complaints there.Despite being the hard plastic, they are still comfortable (my ears are on the smaller side).I use them nearly every day (for about 2 hrs average) and only need to charge about once a week . Charging the case takes a couple hours. After that, simply returning the buds to the case will charge them.I noticed after a few weeks that your phone will tell you the buds battery percentage of you pull down the drop down menu and look at your Bluetooth icon. I think that's helpful .The only issue I've had is with them not connecting right away when taking them out the case. But maybe the battery was low at that moment, not sure.In conclusion, I am happy with my purchase. I searched for so long before buying these.

Full disclosure these are my only BT ear buds so I have nothing to compare them to. They work well for my purposes. Phone calls are clear and people seem to hear me fine. Watching TV and movies on my phone sounds ok. The sound quality when listening to music is not that great. The range is terrible but for the money it does the job and I got used to it. The music is clear but flat no low range. Rock sounds ok but anything with bass sounds funny to me. But like I said for the money they work great. I mostly listen to podcast so no issues. Charging is quick when they run low. They seem to last 4-5 hours between charges depending on what ur doing. Range to me is just ok. I thought New BT range was supposed to be longer. I’d guess I get less than 30ft maybe 20ft. I gave 4 stars because for the cost these are a good deal. If the sound quality for music was a little better I’d give 5 stars.

So these are pretty cheap, and if you are like me, you go to the reviews to see if the product is good or not. And let me just say that these earbuds are perfectly priced. They have the feel of air pods (I'll let you decide if that's good or not) and have the sound quality of an average pair of earbuds. The noise cancelation isn't amazing, but these earbuds can get pretty loud so even if you are mowing the lawn you can still listen to your music with little to no problem. The battery life on mine is insane as well. I  bought them last march or so and at the time of writing this ad, I have used them almost everyday...and charged them like a total of 4 times. So for the low price of these, I really don't think they can be beat. Also, I recently was wearing them while washing dishes at work and the right earbud fell into a sink full of water, fully submerged, and yet when I pulled it out it was still playing music like nothing ever happened. 100% would recommend if you need a cheap pair of burner earbuds.

I really liked these, sound was good and the mic worked well, they paired easily, and had really solid battery life.  Sadly, the left headphone broke after about 5 months.

UPDATE:I’m still loving these 2 months later. I use these for my workouts, and sweat profusely.The microphone is better than average.Sound is good and you can use them one a time if you want to.These are easy to charge and can be saved to two devices simultaneously, however only one connection at a time.My original review had 30 likes and wanted to update my review.Also this should have a higher star rating based price and performance.ORIGINAL:I have the Airpods 2, however I can't use them for working out, as I sweat a lot and have been damaging the charging connection on the bottom of them. I do however, find the Airpod design comfortable in my ears and have been looking for some that I could use for working out. These headphones fit the bill. I was worried as some of the reviews were not 'verified purchases', however these are great. It has a strong sound base, and you don't have to turn it up all the way to get good sound (as is the case with many TWS).If the Airpods or Apple EarPods fit you well, these fit similarly.There is no lag/latency with online videos or streaming movies.The microphone is actually pretty good too (although I've only tried it on my iPhone 11's voice recorder).This is an incredible value set of Apple Airpod like headphones.This includes USB-C charging, small pocketable case and stylish headphones.Very impressed and glad I got these; I've tried too many others.Thanks.

I always look for cheaper bluetooth earbuds because I'm going to lose one at some point.  This set is great but has shorter battery life in the earbuds themselves than other models I've had. Luckily, I only ever use 1 at a time, so I simply have to alternate them every 3-4 hours.  At 8 hours of use per day, I can usually get a few days worth of charging from the case.  Super comfortable as well.

Bro these are mf amazing, for the price?? Its so good I had them for like 6 months just lost them smh and rn I just bought another pair, in all that time I dropped them so many time and all type of stuff and they stayed working perfectly fine, the battery life it’s literally insane, id just use them to workout and thats it tho like 1 and a half hours so idk how it would be for all day use but i would go hella days and maybe weeks without charging it, now sound it aint gon be crazy dont expect crazy for this price but yeah man these are like legit the best u could get for this price on my opinion. OHH LMAO AND THEY MAGNETIC TOO id stick them to stuff so cool. Just get them u wont be disappointed.

I have enjoyed using these earbuds. However sometimes they tend to slip out of my ear. I think this is a common issue that people have with this particular product but overall it's pretty good. I don't see myself doing heavy exercise/dynamic exercises while using this particular product very much. However if you're doing a task it doesn't require you to lower and/or raise your head quickly they're fine. Besides the question will touch features that work when they want to and my experience this product has a good bang for his buck.
"

As far as the quality of sound & noise cancellation go, I think these are great! The thing I am not happy with is that they go out a lot.  The left ear seems to loose connection a lot even though they still have a decent charge. Also what I don't like about these is there is no where to adjust the volume. I cannot find any button on these to adjust. Maybe I am missing something here because I would assume there has to be a way to adjust the volume. I kept them because I got a great deal on them but if you have to pay full price, I would keep looking.

In general i really like the earbuds, they can connect with android or iPhone, battery life in operation more than 2 hours in high volume, and pretty much all the day or more if it connected but not used. The charging is fast too.The only thing that's frustrates me is when i connect them, sometimes I've the left works only, and the other times the right earbud works, I've to put them in their charger, disconnect the bluetooth then connect again, this is happens frequently, other than that i really like the product.

I like to fall asleep to audiobooks so I needed an inexpensive pair of ear buds for sleeping.  I do not like headphones that ""suction"" into your ears and I prefer the shape of Apple's wired ear buds.  I didn't want to spend the money on AirPods, though.  These are the perfect compromise.  They do not have the greatest sound quality, but are just fine for audiobooks.  They are comfortable in my ears and do not fall out when I am sleeping.  My only complaint would be that if the battery of the headphones starts to get low during the night, the ""Battery low, please charge now"" message is loud and always wakes me up.  I would prefer more of a beep alert, but it is what it is.

These earbuds are kind of ""Ok"". Here's a list of pros and cons:Pros- The BEST thing about these earbuds is the fact that they activate on a double-tap, not on a single tap like all other Bluetooth earbuds. This was great for me because whenever I re-adjust the earbuds in my ears, or take my sweatshirt off they don't stop playing due to an accidental tap. A MASSIVE plus for me.- They are not in-ear, they are earbuds so they gently, but firmly, sit in the ear.- They do not fall off the ear during workouts.- Very comfortable.- They look nice and slick.- Lasting battery, no issues during 1:30h workouts.- Small carrying case.- USB-C charging, which means they charge a lot faster than with a mini-USB port.- Low price.Con- The sound quality is absolutely horrendous. There is absolutely zero bass in these earbuds. The music sounds like coming from inside a can of tomatoes, lol.The above con was the dealbreaker for me. I had to return them.If you want earbuds with all the pros mentioned above minus de con, get the TBI Pro Airpro. Those are a bit more expensive but the sound of those earbuds is no less than epic, to put it mildly: unmatched bass and excellent balance with brights (treble).

Left ear bud will BLAST static if you touch it in the wrong spot. This happens when you adjust the ear bud in your ear or even take it out. I already returned the first pair due to this issue and now my current pair is having this issue. Definitely would suggest that you test the left ear bud before the return window closes!!!

I love them. It is hard to find earbuds that fit my ears and these were perfect. They are easy to charge and easy to carry around. I wish that my left earbud still worked properly. I bought them towards the end of March 2021 and by June the bud malfunctioned. I can still hear out of it but I would have to turn the volume to maximum which then hurts my right ear, obviously. I can only use my left or my right at one time.I am not a fan of needing to push the bud into my ear If it happens to slip..because it has touch sensors that I am not utilizing so I didn't  read up on what those do exactly. I know, I'm bad! But those are my gripes.

I love these headphones. After going through two pairs of AirPods in two years (both of them mysteriously died on me), I didn’t want to throw away a few hundred bucks for a third time, but I really loved the convenience of the AirPod. Having been scorned by dupes a few times in the past I was skeptical about these, but now 4 months into 1-5 hours of daily use (and use in the shower) and they’ve been great and are going strong. Honestly even if they died now I’d rebuy for the price. My only complaint is that they’re sometimes glitchy when they get super wet but really it’s no big deal. I definitely recommend.

I bought a pair of 1st generation ipods about 1 year and a half ago. I didn't realize they were already outdated when I got them from Bestbuy. I paid around $125. I had problems with one ear pod not working for the entire year I owned them and now a year and half later, I can't charge them. So I tried out the ear pods instead. So far, they work great. The battery life is superior to Apple and the sound quality is good. There is slightly less bass compared to Ipods but it doesn't bother me and I am a professional musician. Save the $100 bucks and get these instead of Apple Ipods, that's my advice.

I love these items.  Headphones with the silicon earbud never fit properly and it was a relief to find a product that securely fits comfortably in my ear.  The sound and microphone quality are both good, especially for something so reasonably priced.  One warning: Be sure to remove the small pieces of tape from the ends of the earpieces before you try to pair them.  I kept them on, wanting to test them before I decided if I was going to keep them.  It caused endless problems until I saw another reviewer here say ""take the plastic fully off"" and then they worked effortlessly.  Great product.

I wanted a pair of ear buds I could use when I go walking.  I needed an inexpensive product so I wouldn't be horrified if I lost one.  These buds deliver adequate performance, are easy for a senior citizen like me to use, and are convenient to carry around in their case.  The stay charged long enough for my uses.  I mainly listen to voice in podcasts and audio books.  If you have strong musical preferences and are very sensitive to musical sound quality, you should check out reviews that cover this topic.  I am very satisfied with these ear buds and would buy them again.

Pretty disappointing, the battery doesn’t last as long as I expected it to, and while it works well for music, I have issues almost everytime I’m on a MS teams or phone call :/Update, after two months the sound is all jacked up and I will need to buy new headphones….. 8/10 would NOT recommend
"
476,"
For the money, these are great! The sound is good and they are comfortable. I'm only two complaints are the mic is very quite, many people on calls have a hard time hearing me and the ""charging/battery life indicator"" doesn't really make sense, so there's some guess work on keeping them charged.
"
477,"
These headphones are actually very nice, I was a bit skeptical at first but as soon as i tried them on they were very amazing. But there were a few problems regarding different apps making the sound quality bad. When i went on a piano app, the quality became very bad and It was sad. If i went to any app regarding making your own music, MusicStudio, Magic piano, the sound quality just became really bad, idk why thoe. But everything else is normal.
"

I've had these on hand for a few months now and they're not that bad. The sound quality is decent; although I wish the bass would have been better, you shouldn't expect much from on ear earbuds like these. However, I find that its battery life is great (maybe 1 full charge a week or two) and the functionality is pretty good. These earbuds are a nice fit and won't come off during a workout.
"
479,"
These worked out so well for the last months that I decided to get a second pair.I work outside all day and I can say my first pair functions like brand new. The reason I got two is so I can switch back and forth when ones charging I use the other. The battery life is about 3-4 hours consistently.I’ve been able to pair them with anything with Bluetooth without a problem. My iPhone. Laptop. Pc. Smart watch. TV. Car. No problems at all pairing.The only thing I wish it had was a battery level indicator but other than that, a lot of bang for the buck.
"
480,"
Sound quality is really awesome and the range covers a pretty good distance away from the phone.It's just my ears probably, but whenever I laugh or smile these ear buds fall out. They don't stay on that well when working out or having lively conversation.The magnet inside the case is pretty weak so if you drop it they 100% will go flying out of the case.
"

I bought this product to replace an old wired earbud headset.  The old wire headset had: a mic and a volume control button built-in.Other than using it for phone calls and music, I wasn't able to get much more use out of the product.  So, if you're looking for something that would suit these needs, then I think it's worth it.In addition to the above, I bought this so I can use it for Discord, WebEx, and Zoom meetings.  But the earbuds didn't seem to work well with any of these programs and hardly picked up the mic sensitive despite it being set up all the way.  I think if this was addressed along with an option of adjusting the sound on the earbuds, it would be perfect.
"
482,"
I got these for work when I had to return to the office 2 days a week and needed headphones for calls and video conferences. Only one earbud has worked the entire time I've had them despite troubleshooting the issue. They do hold a charge for a long time, but when you only have one working, it's disappointing. The sound quality is decent.
"

The headphones has a really nice sound quality, the battery life is really good and they are great to do my workout. The only minor thing is that they get disconnected for a few seconds if the phone is in my pocket making this a little bit annoy but overall, I really like them and for the price, you could not ask for more.
"

The elephant in the room: sound. They sound amazing for ""cheap"" Bluetooth headphones. Everything else about them was a plus. Battery life is about 3-4 hours which is about right. I'm hard of hearing and I only turn them up to 50% for music. They also fit good. One of my ears had major reconstructive surgery so both sides are shaped differently, and they don't fall out of either side. They work great for jamming out in the shower, touch features can be bothersome when wet but for $30 you can't beat these. Highly recommend

If you're looking for a cheap pair of wireless earbuds, you've come to the right place. I use these daily and have had zero issue with them. Charges up USB-C. 3ish hours charge per ear. I typically wear 1 earbud at a time and keep the other one in the charging case. The earbud will announce that it has a low battery. The magnet in the case is strong and the earbuds fall right into place. All plastic construction with no rubber on the earbud. No issues with sensitive skin on the ear. Purchased in September 2020. Review written January 2021.
"

It's a great deal for the quality. Sounds are good. I wear at it work for my daily use. I use a printer and scanner with loud noises and I can still hear my podcasts clearly. The only complaint is it does hurt my ear after an hour of wear, so I will switch sides. Making and receiving phone calls are clear as well.

Light weight ear buds, fit my ears better than the rubber tip type. Only con I have is the range of these, if you don't have your device within 6 feet they don't work. Other than that I like them.

These headphones work perfectly.  They are comfortable in my ears and don't fall out with movement.  They connect instantly once the case is opened which prevents me from missing the beginning of conversations while waiting for them to connect. Love these.  The only downside is that they are super sensitive and I have accidentally ended calls while putting them in my ear because if your finger taps the earbuds, it ends the call.  Since learning that, I am super careful when putting them in my ear and I have not had any problems.
"

Sound quality is good for listening but when I use them for phone calls, people can't hear me very well. Purchased 2 pairs, and they both have the same problem. Other thank that, I like to use them for workouts. They don't fall out of your ear and they even work for my 7 year old.

Obviously what was most important to me and most likely to most people is the sound quality and the battery life for this item both of which I found to be beyond reproach I had to drive several hours on a road trip two days after I received this item I used These earphones the entire time and didn’t have any issues with having to recharge them during the drive and the sound quality I felt was perfect absolutely no complaints

They don't last long and be prepared for a high pitched fuzzy screeching right before the battery dies. Other than that they're fine.
"

...but otherwise these work well.  My husband and I both had trouble pairing these to our phones/tablets/etc, but once we got them paired, they work great.  I think the pairing issue has to do with the timing of getting the device and the pods to ""scan"" at exactly the same time.  But it also could be because we are not especially tech savvy, as well.
"
494,"
If you're looking for convenient, wireless bluetooth earbuds to take phone calls or listen to news, talk shows, etc you can go with these however, if you want some earbuds to listen to music and you expect a somewhat decent performance steer away from these. Although sound is clear, it completely and absolutely lacks ANY bass or even low mid-range. Just a quick reference for iPhone users ... the regular wired earbuds that come (or used to come) with the iPhone sound a whole lot better than these.

I normally only use the right ear bud when I am at work.. as I need to be able to hear announcements etc...But when at the gym I like to have both.  The left one used to go in and out and now it does not work at all. I tired to pair and unpair like the videos say and it still does not work. I guess you get what you pay for.The sound (in the right ear bud) is perfect and the battery life is great which is why I have it 2 stars.

The apple in ear headphones have been the only in ear headphones that don't hurt my ears. Often would get a tender spot with other in ear ones. These are about (if not the) same size as apple ear pods so if you're looking for that as a factor for blue tooth headphones. Batteries maybe last 4-5 hours for me, longer if I'm not pausing the books I listen to.

I enjoyed the sound quality very much compared to other headphones, the battery life is pretty decent, and they fit in my ears without the irritation of constant readjusting (which is hard to find).  However, the right ear bud is defective and stopped working. Purchased 2nd week in February and it stopped working the last week of March. Of course, for the price I did not expect them to last a whole year or anything like that but damn only 6 weeks. It's a pity because I love everything else about them.

This is my first go-round at a pair of wireless earbuds. So far so good. The sound quality is just fine and the size is bearable. They aren't the most comfortable and they tend to fall out from time to time, but I'll take the blame for that and say it's the way my ears are shaped. 🤷🏻‍♀️

I have difficulty pairing, sometimes it works and sometimes not. I can spend forever trying to pair it with a device and will do the same thing a couple of days later and it works fine. Might be unique to my device, but it is annoying. Sound is ok but can be too low at times. However, I have 2 toddlers and a newborn, so who can compete with that?!

I have been using these air pods for around 4 months now and I have no complaints.The sound quality is crystal clear, battery life is great and they sit in my ear comfortably even when I am running.Update:Approaching one year of usage and it is still going strong.

Wonderful earbuds, super comfortable amazing for working out or even just doing chores around the house. The battery life is pretty decent and the sound quality was too notch.

I accidentally dropped one in water and it still works like a charm. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.

I've had these earbuds for about 3 to 4 months now probably. At first they worked wonderfully the sound quality was amazing I could get calls and people could hear me I could hear them fine. My mom even accidentally threw one of them in the washer with one of my hoodies and it worked fine after that but one day one of the ears started to get really low even though the volume was up loud as it could go and now if I get a call no one can hear me through these earbuds. Sometimes the signal will drop from the Bluetooth and the music will stop randomly if I'm listening to music and the touch sensors don't totally work anymore. But I guess you get what you pay for there are worth the money for the first couple months but after that they're only good for listening to music for a couple hours.

I've had these for about a month and they have worked flawlessly.  The connection has never dropped and they connect quickly when I take them out of the case.  The sound quality for phone calls has been tremendous.  There seems to be no loss of sound quality when compared to holding the headset the old fashion way.  They make phone calls much more convenient.  I don't see any reason to pay more.

At first I was very satisfied with these earbuds- they connected to my laptop and phone relatively easily and I was satisfied with the sound quality, especially considering what I paid for them. However I was not pleased with the battery life- despite charging overnight, many times they would die after a few hours use the very next day.  They also keep randomly dropping bluetooth connection to my devices. At first it was simply one or both earbuds quietly dropping connection, now it has progressed to one or both randomly screeching a very shrill and painful static noise in my ear.  Due to these issues I would not recommend buying these earbuds.

When I paired my device for the first time it showed both earbuds as separate Bluetooth devices on my phone. When I connected to one of them, I would only hear sound out of one ear. When I tried connecting the other device, it switched and I could only hear out of the other ear.I tried disconnecting, powering on off, charging longer and following the troubleshooting steps Amazon has. I’m the end I wasn’t able to resolve the issue so I am returning.Also I wanted to add that plastic on these is pretty cheap. My partner bough a similar pair that was the same price but much nicer. The reason I went for this one was because it has the full plastic earbud rather than the removable tips. But I think I’m going to order the other one instead a after seeing the difference in quality for the same price.

Sound quality is clear. The battery last a long time with a full charge. Very easy to pair to Bluetooth.

For openers: you need to remove the clear plastic from the earbuds, or they won't charge; that's not mentioned anywhere. The manual itself is written in the language of a really smart auto-translation program, but is oddly phrased at times, to the point where you scratch your head a few times, re-read a sentence a few times, and try to figure out what it really means. (The ""pairing"" section was amazing....). Here's the description of the second (of three) ways to turn off of the earbuds: ""Method 2: earbuds will turn off when they run out of power."" Brilliant! The packaging attempts to mimic the clean, matte white Apple standard, but isn't manufactured to close tolerances; in other words, the box is hard to open. In short, I knew they were inexpensive and figured I'd keep them in my glovebox as a backup. As it stands, I'm just going to toss them.

Returning this item. Here’s my 2 cents:No complains with the sound quality. I only use it with my phone and IPAD.Does not fit properly in my ear. Other people might not face this issue, but I did and it’s not comfortable to wear because there is no cushion. It’s hard plastic.Connects within 10 minutes for the first time and after that within seconds. No issues with that.Main issue and why I am returning is - after it is connected successfully, when I browse the site or video in YouTube or any news channel (just browsing), internet gets disconnected. First I thought it was my IPAD, restarted it and browse the site again, same issue. I turned off Bluetooth, refresh the page and boom everything is working. Connected the earbud again with blue tooth, boom internet is gone. Conclusion, it did not work with my IPAD and with my phone.

I was very excited and happy about these for a long time, the sound is good, the battery lasts a long time, and they’ve been great for my workouts.Unfortunately I’ve only had them for about six months and one of the earbuds just stopped working in the middle of one of my runs. It still responds to touch and says it is connected, but the sound is gone. Combing through the user manual, I can’t find any solution unfortunately... The one working earbud is still great, but given I signed up for the ideal of two, I’m pretty bummed and wouldn’t say that I would recommend these.

Moved over from a similar pair that have the noise cancelling silicone buds. Those didn't want to stay in my ears & I wanted to be able to hear what was going on around me. These fit my needs and I'm happy with them. Would recommend them.

So far so great! I had purchased a different pair of earbuds 2 weeks ago. Music sound was great but no one could hear me while talking to them on my phone. This earbud system works great. No problem with the receiver of my call hearing me. These are comfortable in my ears. I love a happy ending.

I purchased these a few weeks ago and they are awesome. They fit snug in my ears with little risk of them falling out. The sounds quality is great, they aren't an audiophile dream or anything but listening to audio books/podcasts is great.

I've had these things for 3 months, and now even with the volume at max the sound coming out is nothing more than a whisper. I can barely hear anything. The right headphone is practically silent. I cannot recommend this unfortunately.

Doesn't work for music because of the meh bass, but if you're watching something or talking on the phone, it does the job. Not too loud either so, for example, I don't use it while running my drier or while driving.

My daughter asked me to buy these for her. Unfortunately we had problems connecting both sides to her Iphone. This is the second pair I buy for her. So She didn't want them. I decided to try them out to see if I liked them so I could keep them for myself. Sadly I did not enjoy the sound quality it felt very organic like something you would get from a low price wired headphones. The fit was ok but its all plastic. Not tips. one fell off with no hash movement so I dont see how could someone exercise with them. I know all ears are not the same but these weren't for me.
"
591,"
I am so disappointed with the battery life of this product. If I use it for more than an hour, I have to charge it. Not sure if I got a defective one or they’re all like that but I wish I had returned it a while ago, now I’m stuck with it.Also, the ear buds don’t stay in and are constantly falling off if I try to workout with them in. I’m sure you can find better quality for the same price. This is not it.

I like the fit, finish, charger and size. However I buy 2-3 of these per year as they have a high failure rate. One side either loses volume so it’s uneven, or fails completely. I just like the fit and price so much that I keep buying new ones. I bought a set for my girl and one side failed after a month, bought a second set and they failed out of the box. I probably need to find another set I like the fit and size of or just hope the opposite side fails next time and I can pair up the working ones for a full set.

Never had the more expensive Earbuds to compare, but these work great. Easy set up and very user friendly. If new to the Earbud market, I would try these to see if they feel alright, before spending a lot on the higher priced Buds.

These are ok, I guess, for the price. But, they sound tinny, don't fit well in my ear (fall out occasionally), have a short range from the paired device, and short battery life. I guess maybe my expectations were too high based on other reviews? They aren't bad enough for me to return them, but tend to favor other earphones and leave these in the charger. I would probably buy something else if I had it to do over again.

I was disappointed because they were reviewed and rated so well and then when I got them They turned on and off repeatedly every 7 mins.. I troubleshot everyway that was mentioned but nothing changed it..the start up sounds and then the shut down sounds.. repeatedly every 7 mins. They had a great sound but the starting and stopping drove me nuts.

Updated: One of the ear buds stopped working after 6 months of use. The second one stopped a few weeks later.  The title should be changed in ad to: Limited life, disposable ear buds, only good for half a year. Expected way more of a time frame for usage before they stopped working. Poor quality!First review right after purchaseThese are great! I use one ear bud at a time and can recharge in case several times before needing to plug case in. My only wish is that I could tap on ear bud to change volume. You can answer the phone or pause an audible and restart. But the double tap brings up Siri… she could go away.  lol
"
631,"
I purchased these earbuds and found them to be comfortable. But the initial pair I received never fully charged and would stop working after about 30 minutes of playtime. I contacted the seller who sent a replacement, which worked great for a while but after about a month, the left earbud completely stopped working. Actually, thats not totally accurate, because what happened was that I put the left earbud in my ear, as is traditional, and was immediately assaulted with incredibly loud static/feedback that caused me to yelp in such a way that my dog was startled. After that event, the left earbud stopped working entirely. So, I have one earbud that works but it is the right earbud that does not contain the microphone, so I cannot use it for calls.

I had read reviews where it was stated that they fit well for those that have smaller ears, etc. so I bought based on those reviews.  They were too large for me.  The standard IPhone and Samsung ones that are received when you purchase new phones are a good size for me and these were just a little larger and just enough to not work.  I never used or turned on, so not sure about quality.

I bought 2 of these earbuds and neither will pair with my device.  If someone has any tips to pair the earbuds with a phone, I'd like your help.

The earbuds fit great and are lightweight, but I can't get them to pair with an iPhone XR, iPad mini or LG android phone.

The earbuds would not pair with my Galaxy S10e through either of the methods in the instructions. The earbuds wouldn't even appear in the bluetooth list.

The replacement set won't pair either. I'm returning both sets.

The sound quality is really not very good. It is tiny and you get the mids up only. No bass. They have good battery life and are acceptable for listening to books.Update: After 2 months the right one cuts out regularly and the left one every now and then. Don't waste your time or money.

These earbuds have close to one second of audio delay when I connect them to my Aorus Elite motherboard. This makes games impossible to play. The strange thing about them is if I only connect one earbud then the connection has almost no delay but sounds like I have tin cans to my ear. I got two so I could alternate when one pair dies, but it looks like I'm going to have to return both since they can't do what I needed them to do.Only get these if you plan on using them for music.

I beyond delighted with these earphones.  In no particular order, here are my thoughts and observations on this product.  I primarily use them for my iPod, listening to books.  I cannot speak to bass or anything to do with the sound for music, but for the spoken word, they are awesome.  They were quite simple to pair with my iPod.  Battery life is exceptional.  I got a solid four hours of listening before they needed to be recharged.  I haven't checked out how many times you can recharge the earphones from one charge of the case.  They stay in my ears and are quite comfortable.  Despite there not being a button to push on the earphones, a tap on either earphone activates a pause or resume on my device.  I haven't tried to use them to make or receive phone calls.  That isn't what I purchased them for.  My only complaint is that each time I want to use them with my iPod, I have to pair them with the device.  It only takes a couple of seconds, so not a great hardship.  The earphones turn themselves off after 10 minutes of no usage.  That saves battery, but restarting my book on the iPod does not reactivate them, I have to pair the two again, and you must have the case in order to do that.  There may be a work around or a solution to this minor issue that I don't know.  The owner's manual is pretty pitiful.  I learned more about the produce off of the Amazon page for the item.  However, I think this is becoming the norm for more and more products.All in all, I am delighted.  For the price, they exceeded my expectations.  Give them a try - I don't think you will be disappointed.

Worked well. Clear sound. Use for phone and podcasts, not music so I cant tell you about that.I'm not a fan of the ""tap"" functionality, preferring a real button with a tactile response, but it works most of the time, when you get used to it.Typical life of one bud is about 2.5 to 3 hours playtime.

These work great and I can walk all around the house with my phone in the other room. My problem is they hurt my ear holes. I can’t wear them very long or use them for running because they fall out.  This is also why I can’t use iPhone earbuds.

"

To sing in tune you really need to hear yourself over the band.I have tried all kinds of solutions for on stage monitoring. Wedges, wireless in ear, etc.Wedges on stage have a lot of problems. They never seem loud enough, but if you get them loud they squeal with feedback. Especially if there are more than one singers and wedges. And a huge problem with wedges is that they cause a volume competition, raising the stage volume. Not to mention they are large and heavy.Personal in ear monitors are the choice of the stars, who can afford to have a sound engineer who is dedicated to delivering a perfect mix of singer and band to the in ear monitors.But when you play in a local band, the sound company often times does not have the skill to make a nice personal mix for in ear monitors. Or you might be playing through your own small PA that does not have much of a monitor section.In ears give the best monitoring, but to use them it seems like you have to have a sophisticated monitor mix, which is not really available to local musicians. In order to solve this I have been using the best quality single ear headphone I could find, and then I would be able to hear the band and also my own voice.My signal chain is from the mic I have a 10' XLR cable into a Rolls PM55 personal monitor. The signal is passed by the PM55 to the PA system in the XLR through.  I connect an Elite Core Body pack to the headphone send of the PM55, and so I have my own self contained wired in ear monitor system that requires no help from the sound engineer. I installed the PM55 on my guitar pedal board.The problem has been the actual earphones.  The mono system was better than wedges but still was not right.I looked at custom earphones but it looked complicated.The Westones seemed super pricey, but in desperation I ordered them.My official report is that they do the job really well. They allow the stage sounds to come through, so you can hear the rest of the band. I suppose they attenuate the local sound a little bit, but in a rehearsal you hear the other musicians talking just fine.  And they have a very good sound. The PM55 gets them to be quite loud. So, yes, now you can have your own personal in ear monitor, independent of the sound engineer, and also hear the band on stage.The way they wrap over your ear takes some getting used to, but I think it is the best system. They are comfortable and the wire hides out of the way, and the plugs don't fall out.They come with a bunch of alternative foam surrounds, but for me the defaults were fine. And they come with a nice box to keep in the gig bag. It seems that the cable can be replaced, but I have not tried. It is nice that Westone is an old line company that will probably be in business when I need to buy replacement parts.They still seem expensive, but they are worth the money if you sing in tune.  I don't know of any alternatives that would be as good.The one downside is that they don't block much sound, so the guitar player still can seem way too loud. But that is part of the deal I suppose, since the whole point is to pass the ambient sound.Oh yeah, the other complaint is that the cable seems to twist itself into knots when you put the earplugs in the little orange box. Sometimes I have to take several minutes unwinding the knot in order to use them.So I would buy them again, and I recommend them to anyone who is a singer in a ""local"" band. Worth the hefty price.

The Back Story :I've playing music live for over 20 years and last year after a severely awful sound experience (the last one of hundreds), I broke down and put down some serious cash on an IEM system.  Slowly I've gotten several of my band mates to jump off the monitor bridge.  None of them want to go back.Doing some research, I decided on the AM Pro-30s and really, I took a chance because there wasn't much feedback out on them at the time.  I trusted the legacy of the brand itself.  I liked the idea of being able to hear ambient noises through the IEMs instead of having to waste a channel getting an SM-58 to do a worse job of it.  Admittedly I'm not yet an IEM snob but I am an audio snob.  So here's what I can say:To the Point:Five months later I don't miss the $450.00 I dropped on these ONE BIT... They've made me a better live musician and a much better vocalist.  I'm a bass player and for the FIRST TIME ever I've been able to rehearse without pushing my amp.  They reproduce bass so well that to someone outside our rehearsal studio, it sounds like a drummer and faint vocals. Only slap tones are hard to reproduce through the AM-Pro 30s without an amp (common with most headphones).  We have a death metal band next door and while ambient noice is nice, I can also say that the AM-Pro 30's isolate well enough for me not to get discouraged by the constant drop-D drone in the wall. On stage or in rehearsal I don't miss not hearing exactly what I need to hear at the exact correct volume I need to hear it.  I don't miss a sound guy making my ears bleed or my ears ringing severely after a 3 hour show.  I don't miss not having the extra overhead IEMs afford you the complete lack of feedback.  While I've never experienced any other IEMs, I've never once had the need or urge to take one out to hear a crowd or something on stage.  My band mates that bought cheaper earbuds complain that their single driver buds distort and they can't hear ambient noise.  I don't have this complaint.  Lastly I have ears that don't like earbuds, they always end up irritated -- not the case with these.  After trying out nearly every of the INSANE amount of attachments Westone gives you, it turns out the best fit were the ones that were originally on the buds. Go figure.  I don't even feel them when they're on.  I honestly cannot imagine custom buds feeling better than these.About the Price:If you've done your research, you'll know that these are about mid-tier priced.  Not cheap, not custom boutique.  I would say you should definitely spend the extra money and get the AM Pro 30s.  I daily these and you will likely do the same (I'm listening to them right now in fact).  Given that amount of use, I can easily justify the expense.  Using them as regular headphones and on stage, Having the 3 drivers per ear is WORTH IT because it takes a hell of a lot of low end to get these things to distort.  As a bass player that's welcome but as someone who also needs to critically hear vocals, that's even more important.  Having that separation is something you can instantly detect.  You're a musician right?  If you're reading this on Amazon, think about how much you've spent on gear.  What do you have without your hearing?  If you're an audiophile, tape hiss never sounded so clear.There you have it.

I’m a solo acoustic guitar player and singer. I perform 2 to 3 days a week. I have a quality PA, QSCs,  and a Yamaha DBR 10 I use as a monitor. The sound quality is great. I prefer to have my monitor as reasonably loud as possible as to better hear my voice, as to not have to push to hard to hear my vocals. I also like to have reverb in my monitor. Additionally, by keeping my monitor fairly loud, it stops me from hearing the backside of my QSCs mains, (the backside of cabinets always sound muffled and to much bass). Therefore, I have to deal with potential feedback at different venues and compete with the crowd noise.Like many reading this, I considered trying IEMs for years but it’s a fairly pricey thing to try. I was worried that my guitar or vocals would sound funny to me and have a negative impact on my performances.  I finally tried them and I’m glad I did. These sound better than my monitor and I hear the front end mix with them. It took me about three songs to get use to them and now I just love them. For me, they cover the lows, mids and highs brilliantly. I can’t imagine wanting more bass in them as a performer. For those who comment that there’s not a lot of bass I have to wonder if they fit them right in their ears or struggle to mix a good sound. I haven’t used any other IEMs and I have no desire to pay a few thousand more for the next step up. These are all I need. They’re fantastic.
"

Two things to note about these IEMs:One is that they're not really suited for outdoor activities. You would think that with the ambient sound feature you could wear them doing all sorts of outdoor stuff (*cough*cycling*cough*), but the very port that allows ambient sounds to be heard acts as the worst kind of microphone when it comes to wind noise. It is deafening. I even tried the cat-ears classic (a strip of fur that wraps around helmet straps and sits directly upwind of the ears), and they helped, but the setup was far from what I'd call usable.The second note is about the supposed lack of bass. ALL YOU POOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED TIGHT, RICH BASS FROM IN-EAR MONITORS: YOU'RE DOING IT... well, incorrectly. These have bass aplenty. What is difficult is finding the ear tip that will give you a *complete* seal in your ear canal. The seal has to be not 95, but 100 percent. The tip that will do this for you might turn out to be somewhat less comfortable than the others, go deeper into your ears than you might be OK with, or take a few extra seconds to put in. But if you're getting insufficient bass in both ears, the tips either need to be swapped out, or inserted more carefully. I waffled around for 3 days thinking these IEMs were ""OK but nothing special"" until I got fed up and tried the fattest orange foam tips. Those finally worked. I have beautiful-sounding IEMs again! And they're not nearly as uncomfortable as my Etymotic ER-4Ps.If you need rich, exhilarating sound quality while maintaining *some* awareness of others around you, buy these. Just... be aware that you can't crank up the music as high as you'd like and still maintain a living-room conversation. Some things are just not possible.
"
871,"
I use these in two different scenarios:1. I use these daily for general listening. I am visually impaired, so I use these to listen to the synthetic speech from the computer as well as music, telecons, etc. Why I like these for general use is I can still hear those around me and I don't feel like I'm yelling in my head when talking to others on the phone etc.Although the sound is very good, they may not be the best for music if you expect a lot of bass – in fact, I would say they are pretty flat.Of course, you can use software to tweak things a bit, so you may be able to set things to your liking.2. I use these for gigs and they are perfect because again, I can hear what's going on around me. It can be disorientating to be isolated.What I do not like is the cable. I find it is not very durable, so plan to find a third-party MMCX cable because you will eventually need one. Overall, the cable is light, so that makes them more comfortable, but surely for as much as they cost, a better cable would be a nice improvement. I looked at other brands and for what these do, they are good for the dollar. I did not want to spend upwards of a grand for IEMs.

This review is for pro or semi-pro musicians. These IEMs change everyth8ng you know about IEMs!  I am a regularly booked 'weekend warrior' bassis and have a decent IEM system (Shure PSM600), but often play in bands that do not, and will not, move to IEMs no matter how hard I try to convince them. So I use musician earplugs that attenuate stage volume by 12db and I live with the stage sound they let in for my bass. But it does cause me to turn my amp up more than I would like.I just bought a set of the Westone AM IEMs with passive ambience. They sound EXACTLY like wearing musician earplugs, but now I can mix in some of the direct bass signal and finally hear myself play!! As for the IEM tone, I bought the AM30, and they sound just as good as my Shure 535 IEMs. I have seen reviews saying the bass is lacking. I think musicians know that IEMs will not sound like full-sizes headphones. I will say I have always used an IEM processor, so I just make any compensations I need with it.The AM30 are more expensive (hence the 4-star rating), but I got them refurbished at a better deal. And having the ambient feature makes them worth it for me. Seriously, if you use IEMs and feel isolated, or play in a loud band that will not move to IEMs, like I do, these will bring back the tone of your instrument or voice if you have a personal IEM system.Hope this helps someone out!

I play a 5 string bass for church.  These IEM's are great.  At least for bass, you need to use the ear pieces that are the expand foam like ear plugs, so you get a good seal.  It took me a while to figure that out.  Once I did, I was in love with these things.  They actually do really well for bass, but if you have them turned up too high, they can start to distort.  Tips for IEM's in general, you don't need ALL of the band to be in your ears.  I put the kick and snare, and then the lead vocal and whatever instrument is leading, and then my bass.  The less you can live with, the more clarity they will provide.The ambient passthrough is a bit of a disappointment,  at 12db attenuation, it cuts out more than I would like.  You kind of still need the room to have ambient mic's if you need to ""feel connected"" to the room.Now is a good time to buy these.  two years ago, they were $440.  At the time of writing this, they are 100 bucks less.

Having Ambient In Ear Monitors that musicians can actually afford is a game changer. The best of the best like Dave Matthews have been using ambient IEM's like the Sensaphonics 3D's for years, but the $2K price tag made them inaccessible to most musicians.  But theres a reason why people have been paying top dollar for ambient in ears. They are hands down, a much better experience for performing on stage.I've used nice JH's, Most of the Shure line, and finally was able to switch to these ambients when these first came out, and I will never go back. You can buy IEMS with 6 drivers for $$$$ and they will sound better than these when you're listening on your phone but put these head to head on stage with any closed IEM at any price and you'll immediately hear the advantage of the AM series.You can take crowd mics, drums, bass, amps, back out of your mix. You'll now get a good mix without driving your monitor engineer crazy. You can actually feel the music, feel the stage, and communicate with your band again.And most importantly. Westone made these affordable for regular musicians. No longer to you have to spend more money on your in-ears than your instrument. No longer do you have to worry about carrying something so small and lose-able in your back that costs over $1K.These and the EAS ambient custom line are the best and most game changing products to come out for musicians since app controlled digital mixers. Start using them as soon as you can.P.S. You need to buy the orange carrying case that come with these for any IEM's you already own ASAP. Its saved my IEMS's from being lost on festival stages and under airplane seats multiple times.

Let me just say that I am a professional musician with over 25 years of playing venues from small to very large. And that these are designed with the performing musician in mind.  I've tried IEM's more than a few times over the years and never cared for the sound I got when both ears were in.  The current band I work with only uses in ear monitors. No wedges.  Over tv's last year I've used dual and triple driver IEM's from the usual major brands everyone knows.  I just couldn't get through more than 5 minutes with both in, no matter how good my monitor mix was.I am a guitar player and singer.  I telly heavily on the stage vibe not only for energy,  but for dynamics and overall feel.  And no matter what I do I just can't seem to get that into the mix on any other IEM.These IEM's are absolutely amazing.  Besides the stellar sound quality and headroom they have as quality triple driver buds,  they bring that element of audible, spatial dynamics right in with what I send to my mix.  The ambient feature of these IEM's is EXACTLY what I've been searching for.  I hear everything on stage plus I hear myself perfectly.I should also add that they are amazingly comfortable. I experienced NO DISCOMFORT WHATSOEVER with these.  With the variety of foam and silicone sleeves for fitment of be surprised if there would be anyone unable to find a perfect fit. Thank you westone for answering all my prayers!

To sing in tune you really need to hear yourself over the band.I have tried all kinds of solutions for on stage monitoring. Wedges, wireless in ear, etc.Wedges on stage have a lot of problems. They never seem loud enough, but if you get them loud they squeal with feedback. Especially if there are more than one singers and wedges. And a huge problem with wedges is that they cause a volume competition, raising the stage volume. Not to mention they are large and heavy.Personal in ear monitors are the choice of the stars, who can afford to have a sound engineer who is dedicated to delivering a perfect mix of singer and band to the in ear monitors.But when you play in a local band, the sound company often times does not have the skill to make a nice personal mix for in ear monitors. Or you might be playing through your own small PA that does not have much of a monitor section.In ears give the best monitoring, but to use them it seems like you have to have a sophisticated monitor mix, which is not really available to local musicians. In order to solve this I have been using the best quality single ear headphone I could find, and then I would be able to hear the band and also my own voice.My signal chain is from the mic I have a 10' XLR cable into a Rolls PM55 personal monitor. The signal is passed by the PM55 to the PA system in the XLR through.  I connect an Elite Core Body pack to the headphone send of the PM55, and so I have my own self contained wired in ear monitor system that requires no help from the sound engineer. I installed the PM55 on my guitar pedal board.The problem has been the actual earphones.  The mono system was better than wedges but still was not right.I looked at custom earphones but it looked complicated.The Westones seemed super pricey, but in desperation I ordered them.My official report is that they do the job really well. They allow the stage sounds to come through, so you can hear the rest of the band. I suppose they attenuate the local sound a little bit, but in a rehearsal you hear the other musicians talking just fine.  And they have a very good sound. The PM55 gets them to be quite loud. So, yes, now you can have your own personal in ear monitor, independent of the sound engineer, and also hear the band on stage.The way they wrap over your ear takes some getting used to, but I think it is the best system. They are comfortable and the wire hides out of the way, and the plugs don't fall out.They come with a bunch of alternative foam surrounds, but for me the defaults were fine. And they come with a nice box to keep in the gig bag. It seems that the cable can be replaced, but I have not tried. It is nice that Westone is an old line company that will probably be in business when I need to buy replacement parts.They still seem expensive, but they are worth the money if you sing in tune.  I don't know of any alternatives that would be as good.The one downside is that they don't block much sound, so the guitar player still can seem way too loud. But that is part of the deal I suppose, since the whole point is to pass the ambient sound.Oh yeah, the other complaint is that the cable seems to twist itself into knots when you put the earplugs in the little orange box. Sometimes I have to take several minutes unwinding the knot in order to use them.So I would buy them again, and I recommend them to anyone who is a singer in a ""local"" band. Worth the hefty price.

The Back Story :I've playing music live for over 20 years and last year after a severely awful sound experience (the last one of hundreds), I broke down and put down some serious cash on an IEM system.  Slowly I've gotten several of my band mates to jump off the monitor bridge.  None of them want to go back.Doing some research, I decided on the AM Pro-30s and really, I took a chance because there wasn't much feedback out on them at the time.  I trusted the legacy of the brand itself.  I liked the idea of being able to hear ambient noises through the IEMs instead of having to waste a channel getting an SM-58 to do a worse job of it.  Admittedly I'm not yet an IEM snob but I am an audio snob.  So here's what I can say:To the Point:Five months later I don't miss the $450.00 I dropped on these ONE BIT... They've made me a better live musician and a much better vocalist.  I'm a bass player and for the FIRST TIME ever I've been able to rehearse without pushing my amp.  They reproduce bass so well that to someone outside our rehearsal studio, it sounds like a drummer and faint vocals. Only slap tones are hard to reproduce through the AM-Pro 30s without an amp (common with most headphones).  We have a death metal band next door and while ambient noice is nice, I can also say that the AM-Pro 30's isolate well enough for me not to get discouraged by the constant drop-D drone in the wall. On stage or in rehearsal I don't miss not hearing exactly what I need to hear at the exact correct volume I need to hear it.  I don't miss a sound guy making my ears bleed or my ears ringing severely after a 3 hour show.  I don't miss not having the extra overhead IEMs afford you the complete lack of feedback.  While I've never experienced any other IEMs, I've never once had the need or urge to take one out to hear a crowd or something on stage.  My band mates that bought cheaper earbuds complain that their single driver buds distort and they can't hear ambient noise.  I don't have this complaint.  Lastly I have ears that don't like earbuds, they always end up irritated -- not the case with these.  After trying out nearly every of the INSANE amount of attachments Westone gives you, it turns out the best fit were the ones that were originally on the buds. Go figure.  I don't even feel them when they're on.  I honestly cannot imagine custom buds feeling better than these.About the Price:If you've done your research, you'll know that these are about mid-tier priced.  Not cheap, not custom boutique.  I would say you should definitely spend the extra money and get the AM Pro 30s.  I daily these and you will likely do the same (I'm listening to them right now in fact).  Given that amount of use, I can easily justify the expense.  Using them as regular headphones and on stage, Having the 3 drivers per ear is WORTH IT because it takes a hell of a lot of low end to get these things to distort.  As a bass player that's welcome but as someone who also needs to critically hear vocals, that's even more important.  Having that separation is something you can instantly detect.  You're a musician right?  If you're reading this on Amazon, think about how much you've spent on gear.  What do you have without your hearing?  If you're an audiophile, tape hiss never sounded so clear.There you have it.

I’m a solo acoustic guitar player and singer. I perform 2 to 3 days a week. I have a quality PA, QSCs,  and a Yamaha DBR 10 I use as a monitor. The sound quality is great. I prefer to have my monitor as reasonably loud as possible as to better hear my voice, as to not have to push to hard to hear my vocals. I also like to have reverb in my monitor. Additionally, by keeping my monitor fairly loud, it stops me from hearing the backside of my QSCs mains, (the backside of cabinets always sound muffled and to much bass). Therefore, I have to deal with potential feedback at different venues and compete with the crowd noise.Like many reading this, I considered trying IEMs for years but it’s a fairly pricey thing to try. I was worried that my guitar or vocals would sound funny to me and have a negative impact on my performances.  I finally tried them and I’m glad I did. These sound better than my monitor and I hear the front end mix with them. It took me about three songs to get use to them and now I just love them. For me, they cover the lows, mids and highs brilliantly. I can’t imagine wanting more bass in them as a performer. For those who comment that there’s not a lot of bass I have to wonder if they fit them right in their ears or struggle to mix a good sound. I haven’t used any other IEMs and I have no desire to pay a few thousand more for the next step up. These are all I need. They’re fantastic.

Two things to note about these IEMs:One is that they're not really suited for outdoor activities. You would think that with the ambient sound feature you could wear them doing all sorts of outdoor stuff (*cough*cycling*cough*), but the very port that allows ambient sounds to be heard acts as the worst kind of microphone when it comes to wind noise. It is deafening. I even tried the cat-ears classic (a strip of fur that wraps around helmet straps and sits directly upwind of the ears), and they helped, but the setup was far from what I'd call usable.The second note is about the supposed lack of bass. ALL YOU POOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED TIGHT, RICH BASS FROM IN-EAR MONITORS: YOU'RE DOING IT... well, incorrectly. These have bass aplenty. What is difficult is finding the ear tip that will give you a *complete* seal in your ear canal. The seal has to be not 95, but 100 percent. The tip that will do this for you might turn out to be somewhat less comfortable than the others, go deeper into your ears than you might be OK with, or take a few extra seconds to put in. But if you're getting insufficient bass in both ears, the tips either need to be swapped out, or inserted more carefully. I waffled around for 3 days thinking these IEMs were ""OK but nothing special"" until I got fed up and tried the fattest orange foam tips. Those finally worked. I have beautiful-sounding IEMs again! And they're not nearly as uncomfortable as my Etymotic ER-4Ps.If you need rich, exhilarating sound quality while maintaining *some* awareness of others around you, buy these. Just... be aware that you can't crank up the music as high as you'd like and still maintain a living-room conversation. Some things are just not possible.

I use these in two different scenarios:1. I use these daily for general listening. I am visually impaired, so I use these to listen to the synthetic speech from the computer as well as music, telecons, etc. Why I like these for general use is I can still hear those around me and I don't feel like I'm yelling in my head when talking to others on the phone etc.Although the sound is very good, they may not be the best for music if you expect a lot of bass – in fact, I would say they are pretty flat.Of course, you can use software to tweak things a bit, so you may be able to set things to your liking.2. I use these for gigs and they are perfect because again, I can hear what's going on around me. It can be disorientating to be isolated.What I do not like is the cable. I find it is not very durable, so plan to find a third-party MMCX cable because you will eventually need one. Overall, the cable is light, so that makes them more comfortable, but surely for as much as they cost, a better cable would be a nice improvement. I looked at other brands and for what these do, they are good for the dollar. I did not want to spend upwards of a grand for IEMs.

This review is for pro or semi-pro musicians. These IEMs change everyth8ng you know about IEMs!  I am a regularly booked 'weekend warrior' bassis and have a decent IEM system (Shure PSM600), but often play in bands that do not, and will not, move to IEMs no matter how hard I try to convince them. So I use musician earplugs that attenuate stage volume by 12db and I live with the stage sound they let in for my bass. But it does cause me to turn my amp up more than I would like.I just bought a set of the Westone AM IEMs with passive ambience. They sound EXACTLY like wearing musician earplugs, but now I can mix in some of the direct bass signal and finally hear myself play!! As for the IEM tone, I bought the AM30, and they sound just as good as my Shure 535 IEMs. I have seen reviews saying the bass is lacking. I think musicians know that IEMs will not sound like full-sizes headphones. I will say I have always used an IEM processor, so I just make any compensations I need with it.The AM30 are more expensive (hence the 4-star rating), but I got them refurbished at a better deal. And having the ambient feature makes them worth it for me. Seriously, if you use IEMs and feel isolated, or play in a loud band that will not move to IEMs, like I do, these will bring back the tone of your instrument or voice if you have a personal IEM system.Hope this helps someone out!

I don't like leaving a bad review, but in this case I am doing so in hopes of saving anyone else some frustration.My reason for buying these was for the ""Ambient Feature"" which is supposed to allow a portion of the sound from the audience or stage into the mix.I am a full time working performer and have struggled with the Love/Hate relationship to IEMs for this reason. When I read about the Westone AM Pro 30 it felt like the answer I had been searching for so I read a few reviews and bought them.The fit was great, the sound quality lacked a little bottom end but wasn't terrible, the Ambient feature however was no better than my BASN monitors that I bought for $60.00 which have no ambient feature at all.I didn't give up there, I bought multiple fittings including expanding tip as well as the Shure cone tips that another review recommended.After exhausting my resources to make these work I came to the conclusion that I must have received a defective pair. After all, these are Westone, a reputable band and not entry level by any means.So I returned them and ordered another pair of AM Pro 30s.The second pair arrived and sounded no different than the first.Again, I'm not one to leave a bad review, but in this case I was a little let down as I had hopped these would work as described.I didn't give up there as I thought maybe I'm missing something, maybe there is a trick to getting them to work, or perhaps a way to calibrate them, or a hidden button somewhere???So I called Westone to talk with a tech and was informed that these are NOT manufactured by Westone at all. This model and the name AM PRO 30 was sold to Lucid Technologies and Westone customer service would not be able to assist with this.Unfortunately the second pair was also returned, Amazon was great in handling the return as usual and I am happy about that but very disappointed in Westone.My final concussion:The ambient sound in these is just as muffled as any other IEM I have compared them to.:(

This is a great set of ears...great quality and very comfortable.  The amount of ambiance from the room is just right.

I upgraded from a two-driver Shure SE425.

The sound is better than the SE425's, although not as much as I thought. Keeping the SE425 as a backup.

I am somewhat new to IEMs but rehearse in headphones and love the control and sound.  I decided to take the plunge.  I am very happy that I did.  I was initially very disappointed by the sound as it was very tinny but after trying all the ear tips provided I found ONE. In my case the largest foam one that sealed nicely and gave a superb reproduction of the sound coming out of my mixer.  I highly recommend this product.  Make sure you play with the tips!

I’ve used several Shure IEMs, and I greatly prefer these Westones because of the ambient noise for stage vibe and on-stage direction from band leaders, especially since I sing with multiple bands and the set up is different with each. I’ve been using IEMs overall for 12 years and these for a year and a half. My one issue is that while they offer a 2-year warranty for the earbuds, they only cover the cable for 90 days. My cable has already gone bad (with use 3-6 times a month), and it costs $50 to replace. Looking at reviews of the replacement cable, others have had issues too. Though the Westone cable is much more comfortable than the Shure cable, I never once had to replace a Shure cable in over 10 years.

In comparison to significantly cheaper priced IEM's these are a definite improvement where bass/drums are concerned (which I my primary concern).  Are they worth the additional cost (3-4x more) compared to my other IEM's, not sure yet. I was hoping to have a 'wow' moment when I first tried them but that was not the case. I am slightly disappointed and would likely not recommend them for bass players/drummers.

About 6 years ago I purchased a custom mold single driver in-ears. At the time I thought they were amazing. I was a lead singer in a rock cover band and only really needed to hear my vocals and a little rhythm guitar. I’m now a solo acoustic artist and a bassist in a pop/metal band. I tried the Westone AM PRO 30’s today and wow what a difference the triple driver makes. I can hear EVERYTHING. The bass comes through very nice and my vocals are very clear. I can even hear the effects and harmonies coming through my TC Helicon acoustic play live. As for the Ambient sound I will have to report back after next band practice. I’m hoping to not have to mix in any guitar and drums.

These in-ear monitors sound terrible. The cheap earbuds that you find at the checkout stand in a grocery store sound better. The sound is thin with no low end. The BASN MMCX monitors sound WAY better and cost one-fifth the price. I cannot return these fast enough.

Don’t waste your money on these. There’s barely any low end. According to their own graph they begin rolling off at 300hz. I had to really boost the low end with a shelf eq on the aux send to make them passable. I have friends that use the UM pro 30 and they say their low end is great. I ordered a pair of those instead. I think the SLED tech for passive ambience is likely the reason. It was a selling point for me because I typically don’t like the isolation of in ears. But I’ll take it over the crappy sound of these. Seriously, $370for monitors that don’t sound as good as $20 Skull Candy’s. Also the stereo plug is wired without channel summing so you won’t get any sound unless you plug half way in on a mono source.

I play keys in my church and we don't have floor monitors so we rely on our in ear monitors to individually mix everyone to our Personal Monitor (in ear). I bought some $50.00 in ear monitors on Amazon, and they sound great (all $$ considered) however, I was able to save a bit of money and felt like maybe I should upgrade, thinking that the triple drivers would sound AMAZING! but NOPE, they do sound louder and maybe they do define a little bit more but I don't think its worth the high price tag. I may just had my expectations too high, and was expecting too much. My honest opinion.

These are amazing for musicians.  Great sound quality, and you can hear people talking to you.  I went ahead and got Westone custom tips for them, and it's even more amazing. Bass response is excellent but not overpowering, sound is premium. They even have a nicer case than my Shure SE535s did.

After a lot of research, I decided to replace my older Sennheiser IE-4 with something higher up the food chain.  I talked directly to Westone and ended up with these.  My first use was plugged into my IPod - OMG! Amazing sound reproduction.  I was very happy with my purchase.  My second use was in a live band IEM situation.  I play bass and these sounded like the cheapest crap headphones you'd buy at a discount store.  The bass was distorted and ""tinny"" - awful.  I contacted Westone to find out what's up and they informed me that ""yes, these open style buds don't reproduce bass as well"".  That would have been nice to know from the outset.  The band leader borrowed them and really liked them, but he doesn't add much bass into his mix.  So if lousy bass reproduction isn't important to you then these can't be beat.  Unfortunately, they didn't work anywhere near as nice as my $75.00 Sennheiser IE-4's so I'm back to them.

I have only had these for a short time but so far I love them. I wish the cable was a little thicker but replacement cables are cheap, so not a big deal. I have used them while leading worship and while drumming and have been pleased using them for both. They don't overload and mud everything together but they do a very good job of separating all the instruments clearly. These aren't ideal for just listening to music but they still sound loads better than apple ear pods. They say that the ambient sled doesn't cause low-end loss but it does because when you touch the sled with your finger they become much more bassy, but that's okay because they made up for that with the way they balanced the EQ. If you touch the sled then they actually become too bassy, let go and you have the perfect eq. I was using a pair of iRock dual driver in-ears (comparable to the shure 215's but cheaper) before these and these are a HUGE upgrade. The ambient sled feature works great, it doesn't let quite as much ambient noise in as I would like but it was enough that I enjoyed wearing both ears in the entire time which is exactly what I was hoping for. Everyone I know including myself usually plays with one ear in and one ear out to hear the room sound and that is horrible for your hearing because you turn up the volume to compensate for the room sound and end up damaging your ears. I got these, hoping they would solve both problems and they have. I almost ordered the shure 535's but I am glad I didn't.

Its so important to protect your ears but i hated wearing the sound isolating ear pieces while rehearsing or one stage.  Those would prevent me from hearing someone talking to me just a few feet away, even when it was quiet, and gave me a weird isolation feeling.  i love these because not only do they sound incredible but i can hold a conversation with someone between songs or when  stage volume are low.  Which you can get if you don't need wedges in front of you blasting away.  Also I was impressed so much by the sound that I had to keep pulling them out of my ears to make sure I wasn't hearing my amp as they might sound better than what I was hearing coming out of the speaker cabinets.  I use these to monitor my vocals and guitar and parts of the drums, I feed them 2 stereo channels via my Shure IEM.

I've been using these in a very loud practice space for 4 months now.  Sound/fit excellent.  I'm singing while playing guitar in a VERY loud room.My cable seems to be shorting out on the right ear recently, which is very upsetting.  No damage on my part and always handled with care.My two issues are:1- Their cable costs $49.99 (making it even more upsetting that it failed so soon)2- Standard procedure is to get an RMA and send the entire headset backMost professional users don't want to be without their gear for an undetermined period of time.At a minimum, I would like to have been given the option to send JUST the faulty cable while under warranty.I ordered a cheaper 'backup' cable immediately, and would have liked to continue using these while awaiting a replacement.

Unboxing.When it comes to packaging, Westone never disappoints with an eye catching cover layout, high res pictures, detailed spec, and explanation of the technology behind the design without too much of marketing hype.  You will also be pleased to find a lot of useful info inside of the magnetic cover as you flip it open, with a detailed pictorial walkthrough of the design, explanation of every component, AM Pro frequency response, and the effect of SLED passive ambience filter.You can also get a glimpse of AM Pro 30 under the clear plastic display window, but I wasn’t in a rush to take them out yet, still absorbing the spec and other details printed around the packaging box.  This experience always takes me back to the days of isle shopping and reading about the product while visiting a local electronics store.  That’s when the packaging was as important as the product itself, to get your attention and to give an idea of what's inside to make up your mind about buying it.After reviewing a number of Westone IEMs, you get used to their similar packaging with an exterior sleeve and the box itself with a magnetic cover which looks the same in all W and UM Pro models.  In AM Pro they decided to shake things up a bit with a plain plastic tray and a foam insert with Pro 30s and the case with accessories below it.Accessories.When it comes to accessories, included is a traditional selection of goodies common to all Westone universal models, regardless of driver count.Don’t expect to find your typical generic cheap S/M/L eartips or a pair of Comply tips in a plastic bag.  Conveniently equipped with color coded stems, their patented Star silicone tips are designed with multiple flex-zones for extra comfort, and you'll get 5 pairs in different length, shape, and size.  The same with True-Fit foam tips, provided are 5 pairs with color coded stems and with shapes/sizes matching the Star tips.  These patented foam eartips have a density with a medium recovery property - not too soft or too firm, and in my opinion more durable than Comply.You also get a cleaning tool with a small metal loop to clean inside of a narrow AM Pro nozzle or eartip stem, and a pelican style “vault” storage case.  This is their traditional small orange case with a foam lining, air tight seal, and a tough construction to survive serious drops.  This case is OK to use with included thin flexible Epic cable, but if you decide to go with a thicker aftermarket one, you better find something bigger.  I like the idea of this case and the bright orange color which makes it stand out and easy to spot, but I wish they would scale it up in size, making it just a little bit bigger.The cable.Similar to UM Pro series you only get Epic audio cable, while G2 remote cable (found with W-series) was not included.  With AM Pro intended to be used during stage performance rather than using for phone calls, it’s understandable why they included only audio cable.  But keep in mind, cable is removable and you can use any standard mmcx connector cable with AM Pro, just like you would with UM Pro and W series.  Just remember that Epic cable itself can’t be used with other standard mmcx socket IEMs/CIEMs because Westone connector has a slightly shorter profile.The EPIC cable is thin, pliable, with a tight rubbery shielding, very low microphonics, and a low resistance tensile wire design reinforced with aramid fiber.  The headphone connector is a standard 3.5mm TRS gold plated plug with a molded plastic strain relief and a right angle housing to fit any DAP or smartphone even with a bulky case.  The ground wires going down to the plug are combined after the y-splitter, thus you have 3 twisted wires going to the headphone connector and 2 twisted pairs going up to earpieces after the splitter.The y-splitter has a slick molded rubbery plastic housing and a cool chin slider which goes into y-splitter like a piece of a puzzle.  I like that earhook portion of the cable is flexible and pre-shaped, rather than having a rigid piece of memory wire that needs to be reshaped after the storage.  Mmcx connector is all new next generation MMCX Audio design with a tight secure snap and stiffer rotation of the cable around the shell.  Mmcx connector is usually an achilles heel for many manufacturers due to issues with interconnect joint that causes intermittent audio dropouts.  Only time will tell about the durability of this new MMCX Audio connector design, but I can already see that in comparison to my W and UM Pro series models, this connector is not as loose and makes a more secure and snappier contact.SLED filter.The whole idea behind the patent pending SLED technology is to combine ambient surrounding with the original audio source without compromising too much the frequency response.  Basically, you let the ambient noise in, allowing you to be aware of the surrounding, while it still sounds like a regular sealed Westone IEM.The effect of AM filter was especially noticeable as I pause or idle the music and my surround space awareness went up to a level of open or semi-open full size headphones.  In general the sound isolation is reduced, you get only 12dB of noise reduction, and you become aware of what's going on around you, but the outside sound is a bit muffled, definitely feels attenuated and filtered.  Once you start playing the music, the background ambient noise becomes less noticeable.  One very interesting observation I made was how layering and separation scales up when you are in a quieter environment with a reduced ambient noise.  Also, while wearing AM Pro 30 outdoors, I didn't have to take them off like I usually do with other IEMs/CIEMs when I need to talk to someone.  Indoors, sound leakage is noticeable about 1-2ft away - not very loud, but you can still hear it.Design.Though Westone is well known for their bean-shaped shells and comfortable fit, W and UM Pro series do have design variations.  UM Pro is usually more plain looking, with a few choices of different translucent shell colors (depending on the model), and W series is black with interchangeable faceplates in different colors.  AM Pro brings something different to the table.The shell itself is bi-color with smoked color half on inside and clear half on the outside.  To distinguish between different models, AM Pro 10 (single BA) has orange SLED filter, AM Pro 20 (dual BA) has blue filter, and AM Pro 30 (triple BA) comes with a green filter.  Both shell pieces are transparent, and you can see Balanced Armature driver configuration inside, mmcx socket, soldered wires, and SLED ambient filter with a path going up to the intake valve on the outside of the shell.  The nozzle is typical of Westone other models and very narrow, and on the inside of the shell there is L/R letter imprint but in the same smoke color.  The housing of the cable connector has single/double dot for R/L sides, but dots are facing in and hard to see as well.  In theory, there is only one way to put earpieces in since they are not symmetric, and the earhook shape will guide you as well, but I wish there would be a more clear marking of L/R sides on the shell.As they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but overall I find AM Pro to be the “best” looking in the Westone universal fit family among W-series and UM Pro series.  The whole design with a bi-color shell, the filter inside, and the valve/cap on top makes it standout from other models and gives it a fresher look.  There is no difference in fit comfort, you are still dealing with a very slim, ergonomic, low profile shell that fits like a glove and comfortable to wear for an extended period of time without ear fatigue.Sound analysis.Before starting with a sound analysis, I put these through my usual burn in routine to exercise the cable and the solder joints of the 3way passive crossover for 60+ hrs.  Based on the spec of 124dB sensitivity and 56 ohm impedance, I wasn’t 100% sure how it will pair up with my different sources and if higher sensitivity will result in hissing noise.  To my surprise I didn’t hear any hissing even with high power source such as Lotoo PAW Gold which I used for sound testing.  Furthermore, my other DAPs and even Galaxy Note 4 phone didn’t require me to lower a volume setting to compensate for higher sensitivity.I hear AM Pro 30 sound signature to be slightly v-shaped, with a smooth neutral tonality, maybe leaning a little more toward the warmer side, with plenty of clarity and details.  AM Pro 30 goes beyond a typical Westone lushness with a little brighter and a more detailed tuning in comparison to their other models, and also with one interesting trick up its sleeve - ambient filter which expands the sound like a pair of semi-open headphones with relatively small sound leakage and without compromising too much of the low end performance.Starting with a low end, you get a decent sub-bass extension with a nice warm rumble and a moderate quantity that doesn't overpower the mid-bass.  Mid-bass has a nice slam but not too much in your face, with moderate speed and longer decay which gives the bass a dynamic driver sound characteristics.  Bass is well controlled, hardly any spillage into lower mids.  Lower mids are a bit on a warmer thicker side which gives sound a nice body and at the same time absolutely no muddiness.  Upper mids are clear and detailed, smooth and organic, absolutely no harshness or sibilance.  Treble is clear and well defined, not too bright or too crisp; there is presence of airiness but in moderate amount.I also found them to have a nice 3D soundstage with way above the average expansion in all 3 directions of width/depth/height - something I would expect from open-back like headphones.  AM Pro has an excellent imaging and relatively accurate placement of instruments and vocals, which goes along with a 3D soundstage expansion.  Layering and separation are just ok, I don't exactly hear the distinct layering effect between instruments and vocals, but at the same time the sound never gets congested or muddy.Comparison.AMPro30 vs UMPro30 - UM has similar sub-bass and a faster mid-bass with a little more slam, mids are more forward but do have the same tonality, treble is not as well extended and slightly rolled off in comparison to AM. The soundstage expansion difference is rather noticeable where UM is narrow and more intimate, while AM is expanded and 3D holographic.  Also you get more isolation with UM.AMPro30 vs UMPro50 - UM has similar sub-bass with a lot bigger mid-bass slam, similar lower mids, while UM upper mids a little warmer and more organic yet have a little better retrieval of details.  AM treble has a better definition, brighter, and with more airiness.  Also, UM soundstage is narrower and has less depth in comparison to AM.  And as previously stated, you get more isolation with UM.AMPro30 vs Savant - Savant has a little less sub-bass and softer/slower mid-bass, very similar lower mids, and more upfront upper mids which are as clear and detailed but a little drier.  Savant treble is a little brighter and crispier, with more airiness and slightly better extension.  Soundstage width definitely goes to AM while depth and height are very similar.AMPro30 vs U6 w/B1 - U6 has deeper sub-bass extension, faster mid-bass punch, and overall more articulate bass, a little leaner lower mids, and more balanced upper mids with better retrieval of details, though both have an equal level of clarity.  Treble extension is very similar, while U6 is a little brighter and crispier, and both have the same level of airiness.  Also, both have a very similar soundstage depth/height, while AM has a slight advantage in width.  Overall, U6 is a little more transparent while AM is a little smoother and organic.  ADEL filter is in a totally different category and with a different functionality in comparison to SLED.Conclusion.Despite AM Pro 30 product description as designed for stage musicians, I approached this review with an open mind to test their performance on a ""stage"" of the everyday life.  By design, they are not suppose to give you the best isolation if you want to tune out the outside world.  They also might not be the best pair to wear in the library or in bed next to your significant other who is already asleep (it didn't quite pass the ""wife"" test sitting close on the couch).  But there are so many other daily activities where AM Pro reduced isolation is a godsend.  Any time in a situation where I need to be aware of my surrounding environment while working out, or riding a bike, or outdoors in our backyard, or watching the kids - AM Pro comes in very handy.  In those situations where you don't want a dead silent isolation and prefer to be aware of your surrounding, and still want to enjoy a rather high quality, very detailed, clear smooth tonality and a decent bass performance surrounded by expanded soundstage - AM Pro 30 is hard to beat.*** The product was provided to me free of charge for the review purpose in exchange for my honest opinion.

I upgraded from a single driver pair to these and the difference is astounding. Ultra clear sound, very comfortable, fit well, the twisted cable doesn’t catch anything and they’re an easy fit around the ears. Well worth it if you’re looking at these, made in the US, great quality and value for the money.

Westone Clear AM Pro 30 Ambient Triple-Driver Universal in-Ear Monitors 78538I'm reviewing these in the perspective of stage performing, using these as IEM's.  I'm a rhythm guitar player and a backup vocalist in the worship team at church setting.I've been through trying Shure SE215's (very good popular budget IEM) to Westone UMPRO20's and now I've been fortunate enough to review these Westone AM pro 30's.The biggest most obvious difference between AM PRO 30's and the other two i've used is that ""AM"" series use Westone's ""ambient patented technology"" which allows outside stage sounds, and audience noise leak thru into your mix.  This allows you to feel the ambient surroundings and engage with the energy of the crowd/congregation.  The other IEM's i've  used completely isolate you from the outside and you are in your own world.  For me, in church setting, I really really want to hear outside environment and the church singing with you.  Using completely isolated IEM's really disconnect me from that participation of congregational singing.  Therefore I was very curious to try these ""semi"" isolation IEM's.**So point #1,  if you were looking for isolated IEM's then dont buy these.  Stick with Westone's UMPRO series which completely cuts you out of the crowd / stage noise.How do these compare with the other two i've used?  These completely blow away Shure SE215's.  The SE215s sound just really muddy compared to these and lack bass.  The Westone UMPRO20 and AMpro30's are vastly superior for bass and treble clarity.  I find AMPRO30's very crisp and clean, not jarring (even cymbals).  The bassist sounds very tight and accurate compared to UMPRO20's.  Perhaps because the AMPRO30 is triple driver while UMPRO20's are dual driver.  There is definite improvement for me between the two**So point #2,  whether or not it is worth the extra 150$ more if you ask?  yes it is.  I would absolutely SAVE UP to buy Westone 3 driver IEMs.  UMPRO30 or AMPRO30.  AMPRO30 is my review here and i'm absolutely loving these.Now these are completely replaceable ear pieces and cables.  You are safe to know that wear and tear items are replaceable so your investment on these are sure to last a lifetime.  The cable itself is fairly thin and lightweight.  Near the drivers the wire is bendable and loop around your ear.  It does take practise wearing them but after a while you are expert.  The kit comes with a myriad of silicon and foam ear plugs.  Surely one of them will give secure comfortable fitment and isolation.  I will however admit, i dislike all of them because i MUCH prefer the COMPLY foam ear plugs.  The ones that work with these are COMPLY  T-100's  which you can buy on  amazon for approx 30$ for three pairs.  You have to figure out which ones fit your ear by luck --- for reference the Westone ""medium"" size foam are similar to ""medium size"" COMPLY tips.  I prefer COMPLY because you can crush them, shove into ear canal, and it slowly expands tight and comfortably.  The Westone foam material is a bit too soft and if you get a bit sweaty then fall off for me and dont have a perfect molded fit.  I will also make a comment on the cable.  It's rather thin and therefore easy to tangle up.  When you put it into your case, it is easy to tangle and when youre in a hurry, you can get flustered to quickly get it straighten up.  I also wish the cable were a bit longer so i can put the IEM wireless pack in my pocket.  It's just not long enough to reach the back pocket so I have to always belt/hip clip it.**So point #3, the given accessories are OK but there is room for improvement.To conclude, I used these on stage twice now and I've REALLY been happy using them. The ""AM"" series really does make a big difference in experiencing the environment and connects you to the energy outside and lets you be a participant in the congregational worship. I think this is very important for me to read off the crowd and adjust the play accordingly.  I will never go back to fully isolated IEM's.  I can easily recommend these if you are often on stage and you 've always felt ""left out"" of the crowd by fully isolated IEM's.  This  lets you get a good mix into your ear, plus allow you to get a good sense of the surrounding vibe.Just one note, i bought these used with ""amazon warehouse"" pricing for almost same price as UMPRO20's and this makes it even a greater steal for me.  Hopefully you can wait patiently too for that deal.

I often use a closed system IEM rig with my band live.  Its great but it takes a while to setup especially with micing the room so I could hear the audience to avoid the isolation of in ears.  Getting that room mix perfect for a show was a struggle too since you can't soundcheck audience noise.  I wanted something easier to setup with less variables to go wrong.  Thats where the Westone AM series comes in.  I can hear the drum kit and bass amp in practice crystal clear ambiently allowing me to just put my guitar and vocals through the monitors. This simplifies sound check, and allows me to run a smaller IEM rig than my 12u rack.  Haven't tried them at a show yet but that will change shortly and I'll update my review.I own the single driver and triple driver set.  The single driver set will get the job done especially if you want to hear the bass ambiently, however if you need to put the bass or any drums through your monitors you'll want the triple driver set.  The triple driver set sound phenominal and are definitely my main set of in ears for all situations now, with the single driver set as my backup.

I’ve been using in ears in my band for over 6 years.  I spent a lot of money on a set custom molded which sound great but still have that isolation problem.  I was curious to try a set of ambient iems.  It’s very different and hard to explain but it feels more 3D.  Between songs it’s easy to tell the difference. While you’re playing it’s hard to tell that you’re hearing any of the room but something is definitely different because your voice doesn’t sound like it’s coming from inside your head like it does with isolating iems.  Floor wedges provide a more natural singing  experience but it’s hard to get a good consistent mix night after night. In ears give you a custom mix but don’t provide that natural feeling.  These ambient in ears bridge the gap.  One gig and I’m hooked. I will say they seemed to be a little lighter in the low end but I haven’t even swapped the tips to find the best fit. Either way I’m not sure I need more low end.., I could hear everything distinctly and the overall sound was really nice.

They’re the real deal! Fantastic on stage and in the studio, and the price here on Amazon can’t be beat. I was hesitant just because the price was lower than anywhere else that maybe these would be knock offs or something, but they’re definitely not. Super happy with them.

Arrived on time and had no issues with shipping. So far it looks as if this will solve the ""tunnel sound"" and isolation issues i've had with other IEM's. It's also fantastic to be able to speak with people without needing to remove them!UPDATE: I have used these for almost 2 years now and they are still working perfectly! I had to replace the cable due to wear about a year in, but since it's standardized it was fairly easy/inexpensive. Overall super happy with them!

I'm a singer in a five piece band and have always struggled with my monitoring. I've been using IEMs for about two and a half years, but they were entry level and wanted to upgrade. The difference is remarkable. The clarity of sound is night and day compared to my old set. The ambient ports allow me to feel engaged in what's happening and communicate with band mates, but in no way takes away from my monitored sound once in use. They really are remarkable. Full rich sound and comfortable once you find the right set of buds for your ear.. Highly recommended by this working musician.

余りに気に入っているので、レビューします。アンビエント機能が欲しくて以下の他の製品も検討しましたが、最終的にこの製品に決めました。・MDR-1000X　→試聴しましたが、アンビエント機能の音量が小さく感じました。マイクを通したアンビエント音なのですが、音質もそれなりで、用途としては、外部音に気づく、あるいは簡単な会話をする程度とおもいました。装着したままの会話等は厳しいと思いました。・Sensaphonics 3D ACTIVE AMBIENT　→機能的には最高だと思われますが、あまりに高価なのと、アンビエント機能がマイク集音のため、ベルトパックや電池等の管理が必要になり、日常使いには面倒だと思いました。自分は以下の使い方をしていますが、とても快適につかえています。◆ピアノの練習のモニタリビングで子供がテレビを見たり勉強したりしている横でピアノの練習をしています。以前はクローズタイプのモニターヘッドフォンを使用していましたが、話しかけられるたびに片耳をずらさなければならず、非常に面倒でした。AMPRO30では、演奏を止めればそのまま普通に会話ができるレベル（やや声は小さくなりますが）です。クローズドヘッドフォンの場合は話しかけられても「え？」「何か言った？」という具合でしたが、AMPRO30では、話しかけられていることにすぐに気づくので、親子の中も改善（笑）です。ちなみに付属のイヤーピースですと自分の声が耳の中で響いてしゃべりにくかったのですが、UM56 カスタムイヤーチップにしたところ、反響音がかなり減ってしゃべりやすくなりました。またUM56には OTO-EASEという潤滑剤を使っています。遮音性がとてもよくなり、音質もさらによくなりますので、AMPRO30 + UM56 + OTO-EASE は自分のなかで最強の組み合わせです。音質ですがこれはもう最高です。ビアノ音源にPianoTeq、インターフェースは RMEの Babyface Pro を使っています。しかし他の１万～３万のモニターヘッドホンでは低音がでず、ペラペラの音でした。PianoTeqの音質がこんなものなのかとあきらめていましたが、AMPro30で聞くと、低音が自然な量感と広がりで出てくれるからか、非常にナチュラルなピアノの音が聞こえ、演奏に没頭できます。◆自宅で仕事をしながらリスニング家のチャイムや電話が鳴っても気づくのでとても助かります。また、長時間の使用の場合、ヘッドホンですと耳が痛くなったり蒸れてきたりしますが、イヤホンはその心配がないので快適です。音がいいのでリスニングに集中してしまい仕事ができなくなりますが（笑）総じて、いいお値段でしたが、十分に価格に見合う製品だとおもいます。私の用途では AMPRO30一択でしょう。本当に買ってよかったです。

To sing in tune you really need to hear yourself over the band.I have tried all kinds of solutions for on stage monitoring. Wedges, wireless in ear, etc.Wedges on stage have a lot of problems. They never seem loud enough, but if you get them loud they squeal with feedback. Especially if there are more than one singers and wedges. And a huge problem with wedges is that they cause a volume competition, raising the stage volume. Not to mention they are large and heavy.Personal in ear monitors are the choice of the stars, who can afford to have a sound engineer who is dedicated to delivering a perfect mix of singer and band to the in ear monitors.But when you play in a local band, the sound company often times does not have the skill to make a nice personal mix for in ear monitors. Or you might be playing through your own small PA that does not have much of a monitor section.In ears give the best monitoring, but to use them it seems like you have to have a sophisticated monitor mix, which is not really available to local musicians. In order to solve this I have been using the best quality single ear headphone I could find, and then I would be able to hear the band and also my own voice.My signal chain is from the mic I have a 10' XLR cable into a Rolls PM55 personal monitor. The signal is passed by the PM55 to the PA system in the XLR through.  I connect an Elite Core Body pack to the headphone send of the PM55, and so I have my own self contained wired in ear monitor system that requires no help from the sound engineer. I installed the PM55 on my guitar pedal board.The problem has been the actual earphones.  The mono system was better than wedges but still was not right.I looked at custom earphones but it looked complicated.The Westones seemed super pricey, but in desperation I ordered them.My official report is that they do the job really well. They allow the stage sounds to come through, so you can hear the rest of the band. I suppose they attenuate the local sound a little bit, but in a rehearsal you hear the other musicians talking just fine.  And they have a very good sound. The PM55 gets them to be quite loud. So, yes, now you can have your own personal in ear monitor, independent of the sound engineer, and also hear the band on stage.The way they wrap over your ear takes some getting used to, but I think it is the best system. They are comfortable and the wire hides out of the way, and the plugs don't fall out.They come with a bunch of alternative foam surrounds, but for me the defaults were fine. And they come with a nice box to keep in the gig bag. It seems that the cable can be replaced, but I have not tried. It is nice that Westone is an old line company that will probably be in business when I need to buy replacement parts.They still seem expensive, but they are worth the money if you sing in tune.  I don't know of any alternatives that would be as good.The one downside is that they don't block much sound, so the guitar player still can seem way too loud. But that is part of the deal I suppose, since the whole point is to pass the ambient sound.Oh yeah, the other complaint is that the cable seems to twist itself into knots when you put the earplugs in the little orange box. Sometimes I have to take several minutes unwinding the knot in order to use them.So I would buy them again, and I recommend them to anyone who is a singer in a ""local"" band. Worth the hefty price.

The Back Story :I've playing music live for over 20 years and last year after a severely awful sound experience (the last one of hundreds), I broke down and put down some serious cash on an IEM system.  Slowly I've gotten several of my band mates to jump off the monitor bridge.  None of them want to go back.Doing some research, I decided on the AM Pro-30s and really, I took a chance because there wasn't much feedback out on them at the time.  I trusted the legacy of the brand itself.  I liked the idea of being able to hear ambient noises through the IEMs instead of having to waste a channel getting an SM-58 to do a worse job of it.  Admittedly I'm not yet an IEM snob but I am an audio snob.  So here's what I can say:To the Point:Five months later I don't miss the $450.00 I dropped on these ONE BIT... They've made me a better live musician and a much better vocalist.  I'm a bass player and for the FIRST TIME ever I've been able to rehearse without pushing my amp.  They reproduce bass so well that to someone outside our rehearsal studio, it sounds like a drummer and faint vocals. Only slap tones are hard to reproduce through the AM-Pro 30s without an amp (common with most headphones).  We have a death metal band next door and while ambient noice is nice, I can also say that the AM-Pro 30's isolate well enough for me not to get discouraged by the constant drop-D drone in the wall. On stage or in rehearsal I don't miss not hearing exactly what I need to hear at the exact correct volume I need to hear it.  I don't miss a sound guy making my ears bleed or my ears ringing severely after a 3 hour show.  I don't miss not having the extra overhead IEMs afford you the complete lack of feedback.  While I've never experienced any other IEMs, I've never once had the need or urge to take one out to hear a crowd or something on stage.  My band mates that bought cheaper earbuds complain that their single driver buds distort and they can't hear ambient noise.  I don't have this complaint.  Lastly I have ears that don't like earbuds, they always end up irritated -- not the case with these.  After trying out nearly every of the INSANE amount of attachments Westone gives you, it turns out the best fit were the ones that were originally on the buds. Go figure.  I don't even feel them when they're on.  I honestly cannot imagine custom buds feeling better than these.About the Price:If you've done your research, you'll know that these are about mid-tier priced.  Not cheap, not custom boutique.  I would say you should definitely spend the extra money and get the AM Pro 30s.  I daily these and you will likely do the same (I'm listening to them right now in fact).  Given that amount of use, I can easily justify the expense.  Using them as regular headphones and on stage, Having the 3 drivers per ear is WORTH IT because it takes a hell of a lot of low end to get these things to distort.  As a bass player that's welcome but as someone who also needs to critically hear vocals, that's even more important.  Having that separation is something you can instantly detect.  You're a musician right?  If you're reading this on Amazon, think about how much you've spent on gear.  What do you have without your hearing?  If you're an audiophile, tape hiss never sounded so clear.There you have it.

I’m a solo acoustic guitar player and singer. I perform 2 to 3 days a week. I have a quality PA, QSCs,  and a Yamaha DBR 10 I use as a monitor. The sound quality is great. I prefer to have my monitor as reasonably loud as possible as to better hear my voice, as to not have to push to hard to hear my vocals. I also like to have reverb in my monitor. Additionally, by keeping my monitor fairly loud, it stops me from hearing the backside of my QSCs mains, (the backside of cabinets always sound muffled and to much bass). Therefore, I have to deal with potential feedback at different venues and compete with the crowd noise.Like many reading this, I considered trying IEMs for years but it’s a fairly pricey thing to try. I was worried that my guitar or vocals would sound funny to me and have a negative impact on my performances.  I finally tried them and I’m glad I did. These sound better than my monitor and I hear the front end mix with them. It took me about three songs to get use to them and now I just love them. For me, they cover the lows, mids and highs brilliantly. I can’t imagine wanting more bass in them as a performer. For those who comment that there’s not a lot of bass I have to wonder if they fit them right in their ears or struggle to mix a good sound. I haven’t used any other IEMs and I have no desire to pay a few thousand more for the next step up. These are all I need. They’re fantastic.

Two things to note about these IEMs:One is that they're not really suited for outdoor activities. You would think that with the ambient sound feature you could wear them doing all sorts of outdoor stuff (*cough*cycling*cough*), but the very port that allows ambient sounds to be heard acts as the worst kind of microphone when it comes to wind noise. It is deafening. I even tried the cat-ears classic (a strip of fur that wraps around helmet straps and sits directly upwind of the ears), and they helped, but the setup was far from what I'd call usable.The second note is about the supposed lack of bass. ALL YOU POOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED TIGHT, RICH BASS FROM IN-EAR MONITORS: YOU'RE DOING IT... well, incorrectly. These have bass aplenty. What is difficult is finding the ear tip that will give you a *complete* seal in your ear canal. The seal has to be not 95, but 100 percent. The tip that will do this for you might turn out to be somewhat less comfortable than the others, go deeper into your ears than you might be OK with, or take a few extra seconds to put in. But if you're getting insufficient bass in both ears, the tips either need to be swapped out, or inserted more carefully. I waffled around for 3 days thinking these IEMs were ""OK but nothing special"" until I got fed up and tried the fattest orange foam tips. Those finally worked. I have beautiful-sounding IEMs again! And they're not nearly as uncomfortable as my Etymotic ER-4Ps.If you need rich, exhilarating sound quality while maintaining *some* awareness of others around you, buy these. Just... be aware that you can't crank up the music as high as you'd like and still maintain a living-room conversation. Some things are just not possible.

I use these in two different scenarios:1. I use these daily for general listening. I am visually impaired, so I use these to listen to the synthetic speech from the computer as well as music, telecons, etc. Why I like these for general use is I can still hear those around me and I don't feel like I'm yelling in my head when talking to others on the phone etc.Although the sound is very good, they may not be the best for music if you expect a lot of bass – in fact, I would say they are pretty flat.Of course, you can use software to tweak things a bit, so you may be able to set things to your liking.2. I use these for gigs and they are perfect because again, I can hear what's going on around me. It can be disorientating to be isolated.What I do not like is the cable. I find it is not very durable, so plan to find a third-party MMCX cable because you will eventually need one. Overall, the cable is light, so that makes them more comfortable, but surely for as much as they cost, a better cable would be a nice improvement. I looked at other brands and for what these do, they are good for the dollar. I did not want to spend upwards of a grand for IEMs.

This review is for pro or semi-pro musicians. These IEMs change everyth8ng you know about IEMs!  I am a regularly booked 'weekend warrior' bassis and have a decent IEM system (Shure PSM600), but often play in bands that do not, and will not, move to IEMs no matter how hard I try to convince them. So I use musician earplugs that attenuate stage volume by 12db and I live with the stage sound they let in for my bass. But it does cause me to turn my amp up more than I would like.I just bought a set of the Westone AM IEMs with passive ambience. They sound EXACTLY like wearing musician earplugs, but now I can mix in some of the direct bass signal and finally hear myself play!! As for the IEM tone, I bought the AM30, and they sound just as good as my Shure 535 IEMs. I have seen reviews saying the bass is lacking. I think musicians know that IEMs will not sound like full-sizes headphones. I will say I have always used an IEM processor, so I just make any compensations I need with it.The AM30 are more expensive (hence the 4-star rating), but I got them refurbished at a better deal. And having the ambient feature makes them worth it for me. Seriously, if you use IEMs and feel isolated, or play in a loud band that will not move to IEMs, like I do, these will bring back the tone of your instrument or voice if you have a personal IEM system.Hope this helps someone out!

I play a 5 string bass for church.  These IEM's are great.  At least for bass, you need to use the ear pieces that are the expand foam like ear plugs, so you get a good seal.  It took me a while to figure that out.  Once I did, I was in love with these things.  They actually do really well for bass, but if you have them turned up too high, they can start to distort.  Tips for IEM's in general, you don't need ALL of the band to be in your ears.  I put the kick and snare, and then the lead vocal and whatever instrument is leading, and then my bass.  The less you can live with, the more clarity they will provide.The ambient passthrough is a bit of a disappointment,  at 12db attenuation, it cuts out more than I would like.  You kind of still need the room to have ambient mic's if you need to ""feel connected"" to the room.Now is a good time to buy these.  two years ago, they were $440.  At the time of writing this, they are 100 bucks less.

Having Ambient In Ear Monitors that musicians can actually afford is a game changer. The best of the best like Dave Matthews have been using ambient IEM's like the Sensaphonics 3D's for years, but the $2K price tag made them inaccessible to most musicians.  But theres a reason why people have been paying top dollar for ambient in ears. They are hands down, a much better experience for performing on stage.I've used nice JH's, Most of the Shure line, and finally was able to switch to these ambients when these first came out, and I will never go back. You can buy IEMS with 6 drivers for $$$$ and they will sound better than these when you're listening on your phone but put these head to head on stage with any closed IEM at any price and you'll immediately hear the advantage of the AM series.You can take crowd mics, drums, bass, amps, back out of your mix. You'll now get a good mix without driving your monitor engineer crazy. You can actually feel the music, feel the stage, and communicate with your band again.And most importantly. Westone made these affordable for regular musicians. No longer to you have to spend more money on your in-ears than your instrument. No longer do you have to worry about carrying something so small and lose-able in your back that costs over $1K.These and the EAS ambient custom line are the best and most game changing products to come out for musicians since app controlled digital mixers. Start using them as soon as you can.P.S. You need to buy the orange carrying case that come with these for any IEM's you already own ASAP. Its saved my IEMS's from being lost on festival stages and under airplane seats multiple times.

Let me just say that I am a professional musician with over 25 years of playing venues from small to very large. And that these are designed with the performing musician in mind.  I've tried IEM's more than a few times over the years and never cared for the sound I got when both ears were in.  The current band I work with only uses in ear monitors. No wedges.  Over tv's last year I've used dual and triple driver IEM's from the usual major brands everyone knows.  I just couldn't get through more than 5 minutes with both in, no matter how good my monitor mix was.I am a guitar player and singer.  I telly heavily on the stage vibe not only for energy,  but for dynamics and overall feel.  And no matter what I do I just can't seem to get that into the mix on any other IEM.These IEM's are absolutely amazing.  Besides the stellar sound quality and headroom they have as quality triple driver buds,  they bring that element of audible, spatial dynamics right in with what I send to my mix.  The ambient feature of these IEM's is EXACTLY what I've been searching for.  I hear everything on stage plus I hear myself perfectly.I should also add that they are amazingly comfortable. I experienced NO DISCOMFORT WHATSOEVER with these.  With the variety of foam and silicone sleeves for fitment of be surprised if there would be anyone unable to find a perfect fit. Thank you westone for answering all my prayers!

Needed earbuds monitors that can handle the low frequencies when I am playing bass. These fit the bill. Sound great just a bit pricey..........

To sing in tune you really need to hear yourself over the band.I have tried all kinds of solutions for on stage monitoring. Wedges, wireless in ear, etc.Wedges on stage have a lot of problems. They never seem loud enough, but if you get them loud they squeal with feedback. Especially if there are more than one singers and wedges. And a huge problem with wedges is that they cause a volume competition, raising the stage volume. Not to mention they are large and heavy.Personal in ear monitors are the choice of the stars, who can afford to have a sound engineer who is dedicated to delivering a perfect mix of singer and band to the in ear monitors.But when you play in a local band, the sound company often times does not have the skill to make a nice personal mix for in ear monitors. Or you might be playing through your own small PA that does not have much of a monitor section.In ears give the best monitoring, but to use them it seems like you have to have a sophisticated monitor mix, which is not really available to local musicians. In order to solve this I have been using the best quality single ear headphone I could find, and then I would be able to hear the band and also my own voice.My signal chain is from the mic I have a 10' XLR cable into a Rolls PM55 personal monitor. The signal is passed by the PM55 to the PA system in the XLR through.  I connect an Elite Core Body pack to the headphone send of the PM55, and so I have my own self contained wired in ear monitor system that requires no help from the sound engineer. I installed the PM55 on my guitar pedal board.The problem has been the actual earphones.  The mono system was better than wedges but still was not right.I looked at custom earphones but it looked complicated.The Westones seemed super pricey, but in desperation I ordered them.My official report is that they do the job really well. They allow the stage sounds to come through, so you can hear the rest of the band. I suppose they attenuate the local sound a little bit, but in a rehearsal you hear the other musicians talking just fine.  And they have a very good sound. The PM55 gets them to be quite loud. So, yes, now you can have your own personal in ear monitor, independent of the sound engineer, and also hear the band on stage.The way they wrap over your ear takes some getting used to, but I think it is the best system. They are comfortable and the wire hides out of the way, and the plugs don't fall out.They come with a bunch of alternative foam surrounds, but for me the defaults were fine. And they come with a nice box to keep in the gig bag. It seems that the cable can be replaced, but I have not tried. It is nice that Westone is an old line company that will probably be in business when I need to buy replacement parts.They still seem expensive, but they are worth the money if you sing in tune.  I don't know of any alternatives that would be as good.The one downside is that they don't block much sound, so the guitar player still can seem way too loud. But that is part of the deal I suppose, since the whole point is to pass the ambient sound.Oh yeah, the other complaint is that the cable seems to twist itself into knots when you put the earplugs in the little orange box. Sometimes I have to take several minutes unwinding the knot in order to use them.So I would buy them again, and I recommend them to anyone who is a singer in a ""local"" band. Worth the hefty price.

I don't like leaving a bad review, but in this case I am doing so in hopes of saving anyone else some frustration.My reason for buying these was for the ""Ambient Feature"" which is supposed to allow a portion of the sound from the audience or stage into the mix.I am a full time working performer and have struggled with the Love/Hate relationship to IEMs for this reason. When I read about the Westone AM Pro 30 it felt like the answer I had been searching for so I read a few reviews and bought them.The fit was great, the sound quality lacked a little bottom end but wasn't terrible, the Ambient feature however was no better than my BASN monitors that I bought for $60.00 which have no ambient feature at all.I didn't give up there, I bought multiple fittings including expanding tip as well as the Shure cone tips that another review recommended.After exhausting my resources to make these work I came to the conclusion that I must have received a defective pair. After all, these are Westone, a reputable band and not entry level by any means.So I returned them and ordered another pair of AM Pro 30s.The second pair arrived and sounded no different than the first.Again, I'm not one to leave a bad review, but in this case I was a little let down as I had hopped these would work as described.I didn't give up there as I thought maybe I'm missing something, maybe there is a trick to getting them to work, or perhaps a way to calibrate them, or a hidden button somewhere???So I called Westone to talk with a tech and was informed that these are NOT manufactured by Westone at all. This model and the name AM PRO 30 was sold to Lucid Technologies and Westone customer service would not be able to assist with this.Unfortunately the second pair was also returned, Amazon was great in handling the return as usual and I am happy about that but very disappointed in Westone.My final concussion:The ambient sound in these is just as muffled as any other IEM I have compared them to.:(

This is a great set of ears...great quality and very comfortable.  The amount of ambiance from the room is just right.  My only complaint is the lack of low end from the bass and kick drum in the band  I've tried changing out the tips but nothing seems to deliver the low end I'm looking for.  But overall these are extremely good, and I would buy them again for the ambiance feature alone.

I upgraded from a two-driver Shure SE425. Didn't want to spend the money for the SE846 and figured I'd try these Westone's instead of the Shure 535 (3-driver) which were about $80 higher.Pleased with Westone Pro 30 so far, although only used about a half dozen times. The sound is better than the SE425's, although not as much as I thought. Keeping the SE425 as a backup.

I am somewhat new to IEMs but rehearse in headphones and love the control and sound.  I decided to take the plunge.  I am very happy that I did.  I was initially very disappointed by the sound as it was very tinny but after trying all the ear tips provided I found ONE. In my case the largest foam one that sealed nicely and gave a superb reproduction of the sound coming out of my mixer.  I highly recommend this product.  Make sure you play with the tips!

I’ve used several Shure IEMs, and I greatly prefer these Westones because of the ambient noise for stage vibe and on-stage direction from band leaders, especially since I sing with multiple bands and the set up is different with each. I’ve been using IEMs overall for 12 years and these for a year and a half. My one issue is that while they offer a 2-year warranty for the earbuds, they only cover the cable for 90 days. My cable has already gone bad (with use 3-6 times a month), and it costs $50 to replace. Looking at reviews of the replacement cable, others have had issues too. Though the Westone cable is much more comfortable than the Shure cable, I never once had to replace a Shure cable in over 10 years.

Had the original version.  Unfortunately, I dropped them to a concrete floor and they exploded into pieces.  I managed to gather the pieces and solder them into working order.  Eventually they failed permanently.  I upgraded to the SLED version.  I am so glad I did.  Not only is the quality as good, the ability to hear what’s going on on stage about me is an absolute plus!

In comparison to significantly cheaper priced IEM's these are a definite improvement where bass/drums are concerned (which I my primary concern).  Are they worth the additional cost (3-4x more) compared to my other IEM's, not sure yet. I was hoping to have a 'wow' moment when I first tried them but that was not the case. I am slightly disappointed and would likely not recommend them for bass players/drummers.

About 6 years ago I purchased a custom mold single driver in-ears. At the time I thought they were amazing. I was a lead singer in a rock cover band and only really needed to hear my vocals and a little rhythm guitar. I’m now a solo acoustic artist and a bassist in a pop/metal band. I tried the Westone AM PRO 30’s today and wow what a difference the triple driver makes. I can hear EVERYTHING. The bass comes through very nice and my vocals are very clear. I can even hear the effects and harmonies coming through my TC Helicon acoustic play live. As for the Ambient sound I will have to report back after next band practice. I’m hoping to not have to mix in any guitar and drums.

These in-ear monitors sound terrible. The cheap earbuds that you find at the checkout stand in a grocery store sound better. The sound is thin with no low end. The BASN MMCX monitors sound WAY better and cost one-fifth the price. I cannot return these fast enough.

Don’t waste your money on these. There’s barely any low end. According to their own graph they begin rolling off at 300hz. I had to really boost the low end with a shelf eq on the aux send to make them passable. I have friends that use the UM pro 30 and they say their low end is great. I ordered a pair of those instead. I think the SLED tech for passive ambience is likely the reason. It was a selling point for me because I typically don’t like the isolation of in ears. But I’ll take it over the crappy sound of these. Seriously, $370for monitors that don’t sound as good as $20 Skull Candy’s. Also the stereo plug is wired without channel summing so you won’t get any sound unless you plug half way in on a mono source.

I play keys in my church and we don't have floor monitors so we rely on our in ear monitors to individually mix everyone to our Personal Monitor (in ear). I bought some $50.00 in ear monitors on Amazon, and they sound great (all $$ considered) however, I was able to save a bit of money and felt like maybe I should upgrade, thinking that the triple drivers would sound AMAZING! but NOPE, they do sound louder and maybe they do define a little bit more but I don't think its worth the high price tag. I may just had my expectations too high, and was expecting too much. My honest opinion.

These are amazing for musicians.  Great sound quality, and you can hear people talking to you.  I went ahead and got Westone custom tips for them, and it's even more amazing. Bass response is excellent but not overpowering, sound is premium. They even have a nicer case than my Shure SE535s did.

Love’em!! These IEMs have changed my life! And I don’t even use the with a personal mixer!!! (I plan to purchase one in the future)Fir now, I use them with the Beringer PowerPlay belt pack, for gigs in small crowded bars with very bad sound & noise, and they have been life savers for me!

Love 'em! They fit great, sound great. The ambient feature is what I like the best as I can hear the rest of the band without turning them up much in my monitor mix. More room for ME :) I'm actually not real experienced with IEM's but I SURE like this arrangement with these buds better than wedges.

After a lot of research, I decided to replace my older Sennheiser IE-4 with something higher up the food chain.  I talked directly to Westone and ended up with these.  My first use was plugged into my IPod - OMG! Amazing sound reproduction.  I was very happy with my purchase.  My second use was in a live band IEM situation.  I play bass and these sounded like the cheapest crap headphones you'd buy at a discount store.  The bass was distorted and ""tinny"" - awful.  I contacted Westone to find out what's up and they informed me that ""yes, these open style buds don't reproduce bass as well"".  That would have been nice to know from the outset.  The band leader borrowed them and really liked them, but he doesn't add much bass into his mix.  So if lousy bass reproduction isn't important to you then these can't be beat.  Unfortunately, they didn't work anywhere near as nice as my $75.00 Sennheiser IE-4's so I'm back to them.

I have only had these for a short time but so far I love them. I wish the cable was a little thicker but replacement cables are cheap, so not a big deal. I have used them while leading worship and while drumming and have been pleased using them for both. They don't overload and mud everything together but they do a very good job of separating all the instruments clearly. These aren't ideal for just listening to music but they still sound loads better than apple ear pods. They say that the ambient sled doesn't cause low-end loss but it does because when you touch the sled with your finger they become much more bassy, but that's okay because they made up for that with the way they balanced the EQ. If you touch the sled then they actually become too bassy, let go and you have the perfect eq. I was using a pair of iRock dual driver in-ears (comparable to the shure 215's but cheaper) before these and these are a HUGE upgrade. The ambient sled feature works great, it doesn't let quite as much ambient noise in as I would like but it was enough that I enjoyed wearing both ears in the entire time which is exactly what I was hoping for. Everyone I know including myself usually plays with one ear in and one ear out to hear the room sound and that is horrible for your hearing because you turn up the volume to compensate for the room sound and end up damaging your ears. I got these, hoping they would solve both problems and they have. I almost ordered the shure 535's but I am glad I didn't.

Its so important to protect your ears but i hated wearing the sound isolating ear pieces while rehearsing or one stage.  Those would prevent me from hearing someone talking to me just a few feet away, even when it was quiet, and gave me a weird isolation feeling.  i love these because not only do they sound incredible but i can hold a conversation with someone between songs or when  stage volume are low.  Which you can get if you don't need wedges in front of you blasting away.  Also I was impressed so much by the sound that I had to keep pulling them out of my ears to make sure I wasn't hearing my amp as they might sound better than what I was hearing coming out of the speaker cabinets.  I use these to monitor my vocals and guitar and parts of the drums, I feed them 2 stereo channels via my Shure IEM.

I've been using these in a very loud practice space for 4 months now.  Sound/fit excellent.  I'm singing while playing guitar in a VERY loud room.My cable seems to be shorting out on the right ear recently, which is very upsetting.  No damage on my part and always handled with care.My two issues are:1- Their cable costs $49.99 (making it even more upsetting that it failed so soon)2- Standard procedure is to get an RMA and send the entire headset backMost professional users don't want to be without their gear for an undetermined period of time.At a minimum, I would like to have been given the option to send JUST the faulty cable while under warranty.I ordered a cheaper 'backup' cable immediately, and would have liked to continue using these while awaiting a replacement.

Unboxing.When it comes to packaging, Westone never disappoints with an eye catching cover layout, high res pictures, detailed spec, and explanation of the technology behind the design without too much of marketing hype.  You will also be pleased to find a lot of useful info inside of the magnetic cover as you flip it open, with a detailed pictorial walkthrough of the design, explanation of every component, AM Pro frequency response, and the effect of SLED passive ambience filter.You can also get a glimpse of AM Pro 30 under the clear plastic display window, but I wasn’t in a rush to take them out yet, still absorbing the spec and other details printed around the packaging box.  This experience always takes me back to the days of isle shopping and reading about the product while visiting a local electronics store.  That’s when the packaging was as important as the product itself, to get your attention and to give an idea of what's inside to make up your mind about buying it.After reviewing a number of Westone IEMs, you get used to their similar packaging with an exterior sleeve and the box itself with a magnetic cover which looks the same in all W and UM Pro models.  In AM Pro they decided to shake things up a bit with a plain plastic tray and a foam insert with Pro 30s and the case with accessories below it.Accessories.When it comes to accessories, included is a traditional selection of goodies common to all Westone universal models, regardless of driver count.Don’t expect to find your typical generic cheap S/M/L eartips or a pair of Comply tips in a plastic bag.  Conveniently equipped with color coded stems, their patented Star silicone tips are designed with multiple flex-zones for extra comfort, and you'll get 5 pairs in different length, shape, and size.  The same with True-Fit foam tips, provided are 5 pairs with color coded stems and with shapes/sizes matching the Star tips.  These patented foam eartips have a density with a medium recovery property - not too soft or too firm, and in my opinion more durable than Comply.You also get a cleaning tool with a small metal loop to clean inside of a narrow AM Pro nozzle or eartip stem, and a pelican style “vault” storage case.  This is their traditional small orange case with a foam lining, air tight seal, and a tough construction to survive serious drops.  This case is OK to use with included thin flexible Epic cable, but if you decide to go with a thicker aftermarket one, you better find something bigger.  I like the idea of this case and the bright orange color which makes it stand out and easy to spot, but I wish they would scale it up in size, making it just a little bit bigger.The cable.Similar to UM Pro series you only get Epic audio cable, while G2 remote cable (found with W-series) was not included.  With AM Pro intended to be used during stage performance rather than using for phone calls, it’s understandable why they included only audio cable.  But keep in mind, cable is removable and you can use any standard mmcx connector cable with AM Pro, just like you would with UM Pro and W series.  Just remember that Epic cable itself can’t be used with other standard mmcx socket IEMs/CIEMs because Westone connector has a slightly shorter profile.The EPIC cable is thin, pliable, with a tight rubbery shielding, very low microphonics, and a low resistance tensile wire design reinforced with aramid fiber.  The headphone connector is a standard 3.5mm TRS gold plated plug with a molded plastic strain relief and a right angle housing to fit any DAP or smartphone even with a bulky case.  The ground wires going down to the plug are combined after the y-splitter, thus you have 3 twisted wires going to the headphone connector and 2 twisted pairs going up to earpieces after the splitter.The y-splitter has a slick molded rubbery plastic housing and a cool chin slider which goes into y-splitter like a piece of a puzzle.  I like that earhook portion of the cable is flexible and pre-shaped, rather than having a rigid piece of memory wire that needs to be reshaped after the storage.  Mmcx connector is all new next generation MMCX Audio design with a tight secure snap and stiffer rotation of the cable around the shell.  Mmcx connector is usually an achilles heel for many manufacturers due to issues with interconnect joint that causes intermittent audio dropouts.  Only time will tell about the durability of this new MMCX Audio connector design, but I can already see that in comparison to my W and UM Pro series models, this connector is not as loose and makes a more secure and snappier contact.SLED filter.The whole idea behind the patent pending SLED technology is to combine ambient surrounding with the original audio source without compromising too much the frequency response.  Basically, you let the ambient noise in, allowing you to be aware of the surrounding, while it still sounds like a regular sealed Westone IEM.The effect of AM filter was especially noticeable as I pause or idle the music and my surround space awareness went up to a level of open or semi-open full size headphones.  In general the sound isolation is reduced, you get only 12dB of noise reduction, and you become aware of what's going on around you, but the outside sound is a bit muffled, definitely feels attenuated and filtered.  Once you start playing the music, the background ambient noise becomes less noticeable.  One very interesting observation I made was how layering and separation scales up when you are in a quieter environment with a reduced ambient noise.  Also, while wearing AM Pro 30 outdoors, I didn't have to take them off like I usually do with other IEMs/CIEMs when I need to talk to someone.  Indoors, sound leakage is noticeable about 1-2ft away - not very loud, but you can still hear it.Design.Though Westone is well known for their bean-shaped shells and comfortable fit, W and UM Pro series do have design variations.  UM Pro is usually more plain looking, with a few choices of different translucent shell colors (depending on the model), and W series is black with interchangeable faceplates in different colors.  AM Pro brings something different to the table.The shell itself is bi-color with smoked color half on inside and clear half on the outside.  To distinguish between different models, AM Pro 10 (single BA) has orange SLED filter, AM Pro 20 (dual BA) has blue filter, and AM Pro 30 (triple BA) comes with a green filter.  Both shell pieces are transparent, and you can see Balanced Armature driver configuration inside, mmcx socket, soldered wires, and SLED ambient filter with a path going up to the intake valve on the outside of the shell.  The nozzle is typical of Westone other models and very narrow, and on the inside of the shell there is L/R letter imprint but in the same smoke color.  The housing of the cable connector has single/double dot for R/L sides, but dots are facing in and hard to see as well.  In theory, there is only one way to put earpieces in since they are not symmetric, and the earhook shape will guide you as well, but I wish there would be a more clear marking of L/R sides on the shell.As they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but overall I find AM Pro to be the “best” looking in the Westone universal fit family among W-series and UM Pro series.  The whole design with a bi-color shell, the filter inside, and the valve/cap on top makes it standout from other models and gives it a fresher look.  There is no difference in fit comfort, you are still dealing with a very slim, ergonomic, low profile shell that fits like a glove and comfortable to wear for an extended period of time without ear fatigue.Sound analysis.Before starting with a sound analysis, I put these through my usual burn in routine to exercise the cable and the solder joints of the 3way passive crossover for 60+ hrs.  Based on the spec of 124dB sensitivity and 56 ohm impedance, I wasn’t 100% sure how it will pair up with my different sources and if higher sensitivity will result in hissing noise.  To my surprise I didn’t hear any hissing even with high power source such as Lotoo PAW Gold which I used for sound testing.  Furthermore, my other DAPs and even Galaxy Note 4 phone didn’t require me to lower a volume setting to compensate for higher sensitivity.I hear AM Pro 30 sound signature to be slightly v-shaped, with a smooth neutral tonality, maybe leaning a little more toward the warmer side, with plenty of clarity and details.  AM Pro 30 goes beyond a typical Westone lushness with a little brighter and a more detailed tuning in comparison to their other models, and also with one interesting trick up its sleeve - ambient filter which expands the sound like a pair of semi-open headphones with relatively small sound leakage and without compromising too much of the low end performance.Starting with a low end, you get a decent sub-bass extension with a nice warm rumble and a moderate quantity that doesn't overpower the mid-bass.  Mid-bass has a nice slam but not too much in your face, with moderate speed and longer decay which gives the bass a dynamic driver sound characteristics.  Bass is well controlled, hardly any spillage into lower mids.  Lower mids are a bit on a warmer thicker side which gives sound a nice body and at the same time absolutely no muddiness.  Upper mids are clear and detailed, smooth and organic, absolutely no harshness or sibilance.  Treble is clear and well defined, not too bright or too crisp; there is presence of airiness but in moderate amount.I also found them to have a nice 3D soundstage with way above the average expansion in all 3 directions of width/depth/height - something I would expect from open-back like headphones.  AM Pro has an excellent imaging and relatively accurate placement of instruments and vocals, which goes along with a 3D soundstage expansion.  Layering and separation are just ok, I don't exactly hear the distinct layering effect between instruments and vocals, but at the same time the sound never gets congested or muddy.Comparison.AMPro30 vs UMPro30 - UM has similar sub-bass and a faster mid-bass with a little more slam, mids are more forward but do have the same tonality, treble is not as well extended and slightly rolled off in comparison to AM. The soundstage expansion difference is rather noticeable where UM is narrow and more intimate, while AM is expanded and 3D holographic.  Also you get more isolation with UM.AMPro30 vs UMPro50 - UM has similar sub-bass with a lot bigger mid-bass slam, similar lower mids, while UM upper mids a little warmer and more organic yet have a little better retrieval of details.  AM treble has a better definition, brighter, and with more airiness.  Also, UM soundstage is narrower and has less depth in comparison to AM.  And as previously stated, you get more isolation with UM.AMPro30 vs Savant - Savant has a little less sub-bass and softer/slower mid-bass, very similar lower mids, and more upfront upper mids which are as clear and detailed but a little drier.  Savant treble is a little brighter and crispier, with more airiness and slightly better extension.  Soundstage width definitely goes to AM while depth and height are very similar.AMPro30 vs U6 w/B1 - U6 has deeper sub-bass extension, faster mid-bass punch, and overall more articulate bass, a little leaner lower mids, and more balanced upper mids with better retrieval of details, though both have an equal level of clarity.  Treble extension is very similar, while U6 is a little brighter and crispier, and both have the same level of airiness.  Also, both have a very similar soundstage depth/height, while AM has a slight advantage in width.  Overall, U6 is a little more transparent while AM is a little smoother and organic.  ADEL filter is in a totally different category and with a different functionality in comparison to SLED.Conclusion.Despite AM Pro 30 product description as designed for stage musicians, I approached this review with an open mind to test their performance on a ""stage"" of the everyday life.  By design, they are not suppose to give you the best isolation if you want to tune out the outside world.  They also might not be the best pair to wear in the library or in bed next to your significant other who is already asleep (it didn't quite pass the ""wife"" test sitting close on the couch).  But there are so many other daily activities where AM Pro reduced isolation is a godsend.  Any time in a situation where I need to be aware of my surrounding environment while working out, or riding a bike, or outdoors in our backyard, or watching the kids - AM Pro comes in very handy.  In those situations where you don't want a dead silent isolation and prefer to be aware of your surrounding, and still want to enjoy a rather high quality, very detailed, clear smooth tonality and a decent bass performance surrounded by expanded soundstage - AM Pro 30 is hard to beat.*** The product was provided to me free of charge for the review purpose in exchange for my honest opinion.

I upgraded from a single driver pair to these and the difference is astounding. Ultra clear sound, very comfortable, fit well, the twisted cable doesn’t catch anything and they’re an easy fit around the ears. Well worth it if you’re looking at these, made in the US, great quality and value for the money.

Westone Clear AM Pro 30 Ambient Triple-Driver Universal in-Ear Monitors 78538I'm reviewing these in the perspective of stage performing, using these as IEM's.  I'm a rhythm guitar player and a backup vocalist in the worship team at church setting.I've been through trying Shure SE215's (very good popular budget IEM) to Westone UMPRO20's and now I've been fortunate enough to review these Westone AM pro 30's.The biggest most obvious difference between AM PRO 30's and the other two i've used is that ""AM"" series use Westone's ""ambient patented technology"" which allows outside stage sounds, and audience noise leak thru into your mix.  This allows you to feel the ambient surroundings and engage with the energy of the crowd/congregation.  The other IEM's i've  used completely isolate you from the outside and you are in your own world.  For me, in church setting, I really really want to hear outside environment and the church singing with you.  Using completely isolated IEM's really disconnect me from that participation of congregational singing.  Therefore I was very curious to try these ""semi"" isolation IEM's.**So point #1,  if you were looking for isolated IEM's then dont buy these.  Stick with Westone's UMPRO series which completely cuts you out of the crowd / stage noise.How do these compare with the other two i've used?  These completely blow away Shure SE215's.  The SE215s sound just really muddy compared to these and lack bass.  The Westone UMPRO20 and AMpro30's are vastly superior for bass and treble clarity.  I find AMPRO30's very crisp and clean, not jarring (even cymbals).  The bassist sounds very tight and accurate compared to UMPRO20's.  Perhaps because the AMPRO30 is triple driver while UMPRO20's are dual driver.  There is definite improvement for me between the two**So point #2,  whether or not it is worth the extra 150$ more if you ask?  yes it is.  I would absolutely SAVE UP to buy Westone 3 driver IEMs.  UMPRO30 or AMPRO30.  AMPRO30 is my review here and i'm absolutely loving these.Now these are completely replaceable ear pieces and cables.  You are safe to know that wear and tear items are replaceable so your investment on these are sure to last a lifetime.  The cable itself is fairly thin and lightweight.  Near the drivers the wire is bendable and loop around your ear.  It does take practise wearing them but after a while you are expert.  The kit comes with a myriad of silicon and foam ear plugs.  Surely one of them will give secure comfortable fitment and isolation.  I will however admit, i dislike all of them because i MUCH prefer the COMPLY foam ear plugs.  The ones that work with these are COMPLY  T-100's  which you can buy on  amazon for approx 30$ for three pairs.  You have to figure out which ones fit your ear by luck --- for reference the Westone ""medium"" size foam are similar to ""medium size"" COMPLY tips.  I prefer COMPLY because you can crush them, shove into ear canal, and it slowly expands tight and comfortably.  The Westone foam material is a bit too soft and if you get a bit sweaty then fall off for me and dont have a perfect molded fit.  I will also make a comment on the cable.  It's rather thin and therefore easy to tangle up.  When you put it into your case, it is easy to tangle and when youre in a hurry, you can get flustered to quickly get it straighten up.  I also wish the cable were a bit longer so i can put the IEM wireless pack in my pocket.  It's just not long enough to reach the back pocket so I have to always belt/hip clip it.**So point #3, the given accessories are OK but there is room for improvement.To conclude, I used these on stage twice now and I've REALLY been happy using them. The ""AM"" series really does make a big difference in experiencing the environment and connects you to the energy outside and lets you be a participant in the congregational worship. I think this is very important for me to read off the crowd and adjust the play accordingly.  I will never go back to fully isolated IEM's.  I can easily recommend these if you are often on stage and you 've always felt ""left out"" of the crowd by fully isolated IEM's.  This  lets you get a good mix into your ear, plus allow you to get a good sense of the surrounding vibe.Just one note, i bought these used with ""amazon warehouse"" pricing for almost same price as UMPRO20's and this makes it even a greater steal for me.  Hopefully you can wait patiently too for that deal.

I often use a closed system IEM rig with my band live.  Its great but it takes a while to setup especially with micing the room so I could hear the audience to avoid the isolation of in ears.  Getting that room mix perfect for a show was a struggle too since you can't soundcheck audience noise.  I wanted something easier to setup with less variables to go wrong.  Thats where the Westone AM series comes in.  I can hear the drum kit and bass amp in practice crystal clear ambiently allowing me to just put my guitar and vocals through the monitors. This simplifies sound check, and allows me to run a smaller IEM rig than my 12u rack.  Haven't tried them at a show yet but that will change shortly and I'll update my review.I own the single driver and triple driver set.  The single driver set will get the job done especially if you want to hear the bass ambiently, however if you need to put the bass or any drums through your monitors you'll want the triple driver set.  The triple driver set sound phenominal and are definitely my main set of in ears for all situations now, with the single driver set as my backup.

I’ve been using in ears in my band for over 6 years.  I spent a lot of money on a set custom molded which sound great but still have that isolation problem.  I was curious to try a set of ambient iems.  It’s very different and hard to explain but it feels more 3D.  Between songs it’s easy to tell the difference. While you’re playing it’s hard to tell that you’re hearing any of the room but something is definitely different because your voice doesn’t sound like it’s coming from inside your head like it does with isolating iems.  Floor wedges provide a more natural singing  experience but it’s hard to get a good consistent mix night after night. In ears give you a custom mix but don’t provide that natural feeling.  These ambient in ears bridge the gap.  One gig and I’m hooked. I will say they seemed to be a little lighter in the low end but I haven’t even swapped the tips to find the best fit. Either way I’m not sure I need more low end.., I could hear everything distinctly and the overall sound was really nice.

They’re the real deal! Fantastic on stage and in the studio, and the price here on Amazon can’t be beat. I was hesitant just because the price was lower than anywhere else that maybe these would be knock offs or something, but they’re definitely not. Super happy with them.

Arrived on time and had no issues with shipping. So far it looks as if this will solve the ""tunnel sound"" and isolation issues i've had with other IEM's. It's also fantastic to be able to speak with people without needing to remove them!UPDATE: I have used these for almost 2 years now and they are still working perfectly! I had to replace the cable due to wear about a year in, but since it's standardized it was fairly easy/inexpensive. Overall super happy with them!

I'm a singer in a five piece band and have always struggled with my monitoring. I've been using IEMs for about two and a half years, but they were entry level and wanted to upgrade. The difference is remarkable. The clarity of sound is night and day compared to my old set. The ambient ports allow me to feel engaged in what's happening and communicate with band mates, but in no way takes away from my monitored sound once in use. They really are remarkable. Full rich sound and comfortable once you find the right set of buds for your ear.. Highly recommended by this working musician.

余りに気に入っているので、レビューします。アンビエント機能が欲しくて以下の他の製品も検討しましたが、最終的にこの製品に決めました。・MDR-1000X　→試聴しましたが、アンビエント機能の音量が小さく感じました。マイクを通したアンビエント音なのですが、音質もそれなりで、用途としては、外部音に気づく、あるいは簡単な会話をする程度とおもいました。装着したままの会話等は厳しいと思いました。・Sensaphonics 3D ACTIVE AMBIENT　→機能的には最高だと思われますが、あまりに高価なのと、アンビエント機能がマイク集音のため、ベルトパックや電池等の管理が必要になり、日常使いには面倒だと思いました。自分は以下の使い方をしていますが、とても快適につかえています。◆ピアノの練習のモニタリビングで子供がテレビを見たり勉強したりしている横でピアノの練習をしています。以前はクローズタイプのモニターヘッドフォンを使用していましたが、話しかけられるたびに片耳をずらさなければならず、非常に面倒でした。AMPRO30では、演奏を止めればそのまま普通に会話ができるレベル（やや声は小さくなりますが）です。クローズドヘッドフォンの場合は話しかけられても「え？」「何か言った？」という具合でしたが、AMPRO30では、話しかけられていることにすぐに気づくので、親子の中も改善（笑）です。ちなみに付属のイヤーピースですと自分の声が耳の中で響いてしゃべりにくかったのですが、UM56 カスタムイヤーチップにしたところ、反響音がかなり減ってしゃべりやすくなりました。またUM56には OTO-EASEという潤滑剤を使っています。遮音性がとてもよくなり、音質もさらによくなりますので、AMPRO30 + UM56 + OTO-EASE は自分のなかで最強の組み合わせです。音質ですがこれはもう最高です。ビアノ音源にPianoTeq、インターフェースは RMEの Babyface Pro を使っています。しかし他の１万～３万のモニターヘッドホンでは低音がでず、ペラペラの音でした。PianoTeqの音質がこんなものなのかとあきらめていましたが、AMPro30で聞くと、低音が自然な量感と広がりで出てくれるからか、非常にナチュラルなピアノの音が聞こえ、演奏に没頭できます。◆自宅で仕事をしながらリスニング家のチャイムや電話が鳴っても気づくのでとても助かります。また、長時間の使用の場合、ヘッドホンですと耳が痛くなったり蒸れてきたりしますが、イヤホンはその心配がないので快適です。音がいいのでリスニングに集中してしまい仕事ができなくなりますが（笑）総じて、いいお値段でしたが、十分に価格に見合う製品だとおもいます。私の用途では AMPRO30一択でしょう。本当に買ってよかったです。

I have had these earbuds for little over a year now and I can confidently say that I have fallen in love with this brand. The sound quality is really good. That being said there are somethings that can be annoying or glitchy with this product. Whenever you are adjusting the earbuds in your ears it is really easy to accidentally pause whatever you are listening to or to turn up or down the volume so be warned. Sometimes when you take the earbuds out of the case one or both of them wont turn on you you have take them in and out of the case again. That being said these are the best wireless earbuds I have ever had for a really good price. I really do recommend them.

I use this these for phone calls mostly. They are very comfortable. It’s hard to know the battery level because it’s basically just a single light that blinks and you have to know how many blinks mean how full the battery is.

I've bought these headphones twice now, and have had incredible experiences with both. The large variety of earbud sizes are a life saver (I've got weirdly tiny ears haha and the larger buds always fall out) and the sound comes through clear with no static no matter the volume. They're cute and pink, stay connected even when I'm all the way across the house in the basement, cancel out all surrounding noise, charge quickly, and hold their charge for a long while to the point where I'll often find myself wondering how they're not dead yet! My absolute favourite part is that when I work out I sweat an abnormal amount lol and most headphones tend to short out despite being ""water resistant"", but these have never given me any issues whatsoever!! They've been an absolute dream! Recently, however, my earphones charging case was stolen from my car, and I was frantically trying to find a cheap replacement for the case but was unsuccessful. I took my chances with emailing the company because their storefront said they replace missing parts, although I didn't think I qualified since I had bought my pair back in 2021, almost a full year ago. I was thoroughly shocked when representative Lilian emailed me back only 3 days later and told me they'd send me a new set!! I was completely going out on a limb and I've never experienced this level of customer service from any other company, especially through only email! The level of attentiveness and accommodation from this company, especially one with such affordable well made products, makes them absolutely worthy of a 10 star rating if only there were an option! I would choose these products over any apple products any day the two services and prices can't even begin to compare. If you need earphones do NOT hesitate to get these they're the best!!!

They started off well enough. Only initial gripe was that the volume on calls when set to maximum was still rather low. All other situations the volume is great. They’re also pretty comfortable and have adjustable ear pieces to better fit your ear.The reason for the low star review is because within two months the right earbud no longer makes a connection when placed in the case, so it won’t disconnect, turn off or charge when placed in the case. Making it effectively useless once the charge ran out.Update: they have a 1-year warranty and the seller graciously reached out to replace the original set. I’ve adjusted my rating and will happily up it to five stars if this set lasts longer than the previous pair. Thank you!

So, I purchased these replacing a pair of bluetooth headphones connected together by a wire.  I purchased them for mostly use with phone calls.  With that said, I was initially impressed with the sale price of $20 and i wasn't expecting the quality of a $200 pair.  Like other reviewers said, I too find it difficult to remove them from the case.  Pairing was done in a snap and the quickly connect each time they are removed from the case and they fit securely in your ears.  Battery life excellent.  As for sound quality, for music, I find no issue at all, but for phone calls, which is what I use them mostly for, I find the volume during phone calls insufficient.  I initially thought it was just the caller not talking loud enough, but found this issue to be with all the calls even though my device volume is at it's max.  I also find the noise cancelling feature almost nonexistent.  I had better noise cancelling from my previous ones.  Another issue also mentioned by other users is, the controls on the ear bud is way to sensitive.  If i attempt to adjust the position of the ear bud in my ear, the music will start playing, it is very difficult to get around this issue.  Are they worth keeping? Yes, but definitely wouldn't buy them again.

This is my second pair of these earbuds. The first we’re dropped/thrown while in the case numerous times by my kids before they stopped being able to charge. These work just as well as my first pair although I did have a hard time getting them to stay paired the first few times I used them. I had to “forget” them from my phone and re-pair them. Haven’t had that issue lately though. Definitely worth the cost!

This is a great product for the price but there is a small issue which is that there is a small but notable delay with the video and the audio.  This wouldn’t be a problem if you are just listening to something, but if you are watching a video using this device, you might notice a small delay with the sound.

I don't know how you can do better these in terms of value for money.  Don't expect them to be the greatest pair of bluetooth earbuds in the world, but they're incredible for the price.Highs:- Excellent in-ear stability: I frequently find that headphones wiggle out of my left ear, so this was a top priority for me as a runner.  I just went for a 10 mile run and there was no hint of any loosening in either ear, which was pretty surprising.  My wife uses her pair for exercise involving a lot of lateral and up and down movement, and she has no problems with them falling out either.- Great sound quality for price: I'm not an audiophile, so I'm sure some people would have qualms, but I can't remember ever purchasing a pair of headphones at $50 or below and having better audio quality.  They're a heck of a lot better than many other $30-ish dollar pairs I've found- Controls for volume and stopping with just a tap of the finger: Some other headphones don't have those features at this price point.- Good enough water resistance to run in the rainLows- The volume and play/pause tapping are a bit finicky: Sometimes I accidentally skip a podcast episode when I mean to just pause.-Wish they were waterproof: But what brand DOES have full waterproofing for $30?- Battery life: I've only used them in spurts of an hour or less, but their battery life rating isn't as high as other products.  Again, for $30 though, what do you expect?  Also, I don't need to run both earbuds straight for 7 hours without ever popping back in the case to charge?  How many people truly need better battery life than that?- They don't make me an Oreo milkshake: I asked these headphones to make me one, and I got no response.  A bit disappointing.

These will do quite nicely.  My daughter is caught up in brands and the faux need to be authentic with them.  Well, that was until she lost her airpods and i was not going to buy her any new ones.

I'm going to skip all the extra and just cut to the chase. I got these earphones hoping for an ""ok"" set of ear buds. In my opinion they are actually really great earbuds.Sensitivity- My earbuds weren't as sensitive as others are claiming so maybe that issue has been remedied or theirs were defective as the controls act sensible when using them.The case is quite small and versatile in the pocket or bag etc. (Type C charging also = win)An issue (to me) was the design...the case cover kind of gets in the way of getting the headphones out...still easy to get them out,just not as ergonomic as you think until you remove them. I'm sure someone with smaller hands would have no issues to note...but its still not a con to me,just a very minor inconvenience.The headphones feel solid,sturdy and built well as well as the rubber ear pieces...they are snug on the earphones,the earphones sit snug and secure and very comfortable. They come with quite a few sets of rubber tips to fit any ear.NOW: The volume is pretty high when you want it which I love ....The sound quality. It is quite fantastic,plenty of low bass. I tested the frequencies myself...its very stable across the whole range 20-20k... they start dropping off at 40hz but maintain great control and sound levels all the way to 20hz...clean bass... thuddering bass. I can't explain this in detail enough bc you almost feel the lows in you bones even though you can't hear these headphones in someone else's ears at all...Now for the punchy bass...as well as the very low bass which is great...the punchy bass is where these shine...kick drums and punchy bass lines sound GREAT on these headphones. All in all...the frequency range is very flat with no ""major"" tipping points like how most headphones fall off at 60hz and under.The Noise canceling does really good,you can still hear things...but barely (with the headphones off of course). And the battery life is as advertised...plenty of time on these to jam out.As I am an avid Amazon Reviewer...if any issues arise,I will update this review the same day.Highly recommended for the price 10/10...

I like the fact that this product provides different sizes for the in-ear covers even down to extra small.  I like that this product lets me know when my ear buds need to be recharged.  When I put them back into their case the light on the bottom will start to blink.  I like that the ear buds only take 15 minutes to recharge/charge.  I absolutely LOVE that they came in more than just white/black.  I was able to order it in my favorite color (red) and that's ALWAYS a plus for any product regardless of price.  In short, I'm happy with what I chose to purchase and even got $10 off normal price when I purchased.  If you're looking for an alternative to name brand prices consider this product.  My only ""concern""/""complaint"" is that @ least one time a friend reported that she could hear someone else on the phone w/me even though I was alone.  My guess is it's because you have to use the ear buds w/blue-tooth.  Not sure but so far it's only happened once.  I couldn't hear the voice(s) she said she was hearing so it may have been on her end and not mine.  Would I purchase this product from this company again?  Yes.  Good price.  Good product.

It doesn't even have a battery meter, not the easier to put back the ear buds. Sometimes you put the ear buds back in the case and it still connects to you phone.

These are a really solid value alternative to airpods for someone who doesn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on earbuds. I lost my apple AirPods didn’t want to go right back out and spend $179. I found the AIHOOR Wireless Earbuds (listed now for $30 plus a 10% off coupon). Are they as amazing as Apple AirPods? No. It takes a little getting used to which one is for which ear and putting them back in the case is awkward, but I’ve had these now for a long time, and very satisfied.They are very rugged. I’ve dropped them I don’t know how many times and they still work great. The battery life is phenomenal. I went on a one week vacation and forgot the charging case, I was so stressed out, but they lasted all week! The case kept recharging the earbuds every day and never ran out itself. I have no idea the upper limit on how long the case would last.Honestly, the best thing about them, is that if you loose then or they break somehow, it’s $30… just buy another pair. I feel like I’ve gotten my money’s worth many times over and am very satisfied. You should buy these even as a black up if you own Apple AirPods.I think a few tweaks in the design and Apple would have a real rival. 5/5 stars

I love these little things. My husband has name brand ones for work. I got these for audiobook listening and ended up using them for phone calls as well. They function great. When their charge gets low the reception is spotty but charging fixes that up. The features are very similar to older version AirPods with the tapping to play and multiple charges in the case. These have been a lifesaver postpartum - often I was trapped under a sleeping baby and this way I could still make/receive calls, listen to music or a book, or even scroll social media with sound (a luxury). Great for any boring tasks like cleaning too. For the money (on sale at $24) it’s a great buy and works above expectations.

These are very handy to have when you need to be hands free.  I use them when I'm working in the kitchen and I want to talk on the phone for a bit.

To the people saying that these are as good as a set of AirPods, you are crazy. That being said they are decent for the price. The sound quality is just okay, the bass is definitely lacking but they are earbuds so I didn’t expect booming bass. The build quality seems very good. The charging case is nice and fits well. The batteries seem to last a long time but I haven’t run them dead yet. Pairing is easy but the voice is a bit annoying, would have preferred just a pairing noise or chime. The side buttons are a bit annoying at first because that’s where you would naturally push on the buds in if they start to wiggle loose. I got used to it after a while but I still hit them accidentally sometimes. The real deal breaker for me is the noticeable delay. If you’re watching a video or playing a game it’s pretty obvious. If you just use them for music it wouldn’t matter but the sound being delayed from the video noticeably pretty much ruins it. For a cheap pair of music headphones they are great but I can’t recommend them for anything else.

I work in a warehouse, can have a single bud in for safety.The battery life for a single ear bud if fully charged overnight the night before maybe 5 hours if I’m lucky. However a quick switch off from the docker case and good to go. Maybe that’s not for everyone, but if you can handle it and make it through the work day, then you’re great.Also I forgot an earbud in my pocket of my leggings and washed and dried that load of laundry. Upon discovering it, I picked it up and placed it in the docker case. Lit right up and STILL WORKS like nothing ever happened.So for the price, I cannot complain, but what made me write the review was the fact I washed and dried laundry with one in the pocket and it still works. I mean don’t go out there and run over it with a car. I’m sure the durability has their limits.Won’t go wrong with these if you’re looking for cheaper replacements to the beloved earbuds you killed and are on a budget and cannot get the precious Air pods yet.

So overall for the price your getting a decent wireless headset.. is it a name brand quality? That depends on what you are looking for. For me I was looking for a good bass, ease of access and comfort. Pretty standard. Pros: battery life has been great! ( I usually charge it after use and or before use for at least 20/30 mins if I know I'll be using them for a few hours straight) the case it comes with is nice, easy to use. The bass is pretty good too! It does cancel out noise and your not left feeling like your listening to music on the radio. Cons: it tends to glitch a little. When I say glitch I mean your listening to something and it glitches out for a second. The other con is that they are NOT sweatproof. If your working out they will slip a little. Now im not sure if there is truly a brand out there that doesn't, because the earpiece has rubber on it so it would make sense that if it gets moisture in it it'll move. I have not done extreme exercise in them, so I cannot fairly say if your moving around alot or jumping if they would stay in place. I don't care for the finger tap access to pause or skip, not my favorite feature. But that's just me. Overall for the price I think its a good deal.

Ordered these October 14th last year. They worked pretty well since then but have just begun to have connectivity issues (one earbud will connect while the other earbud fails to do so or vice versa).The voice telling me whether the buds are connected, disconnected, powered on or off or pairing has gotten kind of annoying, but for $30 earbuds that attempt to do what AirPods do, this may be the best you will get. Don't expect them to last for over a year without one or two issues.

I lost one of the earbuds at the park and after finding it 48 hours later after at least 4 rounds of the sprinklers saturating the grass that it was lost in, it still worked perfectly.

I lost my left Apple AurPod Pro and bought these while finding a replacement.  Love them after a week!  Good sound and good battery.  Today I got a replacement airpod and can compare.  AirPod Pro slightly tighter bass, slightly more musical, with a little more fatigue at loud volumes for extended periods.  For the price you can’t beat these.  Unless your a audiophile trying to use these with Tidal Ultra HiFi - you will be happy.  Even as an Audiophile you can’t complain for the price.  Battery is comparable to Apple AirPod so far.  However cheaper products have a tendency to show these deficiencies after a couple months - so we will see.  So far Woozers glad I got them.

I had the puds for less than a month, but I liked them. They're small and comfortable and can fit anywhere.With that being said, they sadly got into the washer and dryer and that wasn't a fight they could win. The case and left ear pud still worked but the right one was unresponsive. So after going to AIHOOR's website, I found that I could do a free return and get a replacement. Lilian, (the sales rep I talked to) was very helpful and responded quickly. She gave suggestions on what to do and after that didn't work I was able to send my info to get a replacement set.Honestly, from me, it's a solid 10/10 for the product and the company!

These earbuds are comfortable and stay in place well. It is a bit annoying that they turn off and on to easily when I’m just adjusting them or tucking my hair back.

The bass on these things is INCREDIBLE!! (A2 model). I’ve been on a purchasing/returning cycle trying to find a decent pair of wireless earbuds and I’ve found a few good ones, but these.. wow. Amazing and clear sound, (so much better than the AirPod Pro dupes I found on here), the BASS is crazy compared to other earbuds I’ve tried. They are super comfy and stay put in your ears, (and I have small, sensitive ear holes lol 😆). These are perfection to me. The charging case is just a little bigger than an AirPods Pro case and very good quality, not super cheap feeling like others. 1000% recommend these. If you get them, test the bass out with “A Milli” by Lil Wayne. Just trust me, you won’t be disappointed. P.S.  I’m buying a second pair right now as back up because I never want to be without these!

I wanted a cheap pair of bluetooth earbuds because I'm sick of wires. I don't really use headphones often enough to justify the high price of them and I'm not much of an audiophile at all. That being said, music still sounds really good on these. If you're looking for a high quality earbud, you're probably not even looking at these reviews anyway since you're probably out there looking at Sennheisers or something like that.Airhoor is certainly not a name brand but I'm pleasantly surprised. They were really easy to connect to your phone and don't require any additional apps to run. I tried listening to music and podcasts, they sound great.The only complaint I have about these is that they're very loud. I have to lower my phone volume almost all the way to mute to get them to a comfortable sound level. I'm not sure why they designed them so loud because they're definitely going to give you hearing loss issues if you're even at 50% volume.As a final note, it comes with 4 different size rubber ear pieces to try to fit your ear properly and with a VERY short USB-C charging cable. The charging cable is only about 7-8"". Fortunately you probably have some spare USB-C cables as they're becoming the standard for most products.Overall, if you're looking for a budget pair of earbuds, look no further. I'm not even sure if you'll find another pair of earbuds this cheap. Regardless, they're a great option for everyone. Even if you really want high quality head phones, this could make a good back up pair if you're going on vacation or something and don't want to risk losing an expensive pair of earbuds.

I use my earbuds at work; usually only the L or R at any one time because I have to hear when people talk to me.I inadvertently tucked the left I to my back pocket of my jeans and forgot where it was for close to a week.Well, laundry day arrives at which time I locate the earbud IN the washing machine after washing clothes.  I was sure it was done for.Nope. I walked into the living room to show it to my husband and a light comes on. The thing connected to my phone!

My family has many different sets of earbuds - for AirPods, Bose noise cancelling, down to a knock off set someone got on vacation in Florida.  I use my earbuds for audio books, business calls and music during walks and exercise.I am always looking for a quality sound and long battery life. I read the reviews of these during Prime Days and decided to get a pair. The first thing I noticed was they come with 4 sizes in earbuds, making for a better fit. After a short charge they were ready for a test run.The sound quality is amazing, as good as the Bose - giving real depth to your music. The battery lasts longer than my AirPods.I’m thinking about getting several pairs for stocking stuffers!

These are not top of the line, I am sure the ones from Apple are better, but for the price they are pretty good. To the touch they feel great, 5 stars on that. I haven't had any issue with battery life, but I have not continuously listen to them for more than 2-3 hours. They are not too sensitive, and sometimes I'd need to push couple of times to pause audio. Mic works fine indoors. If there is any sort of wind or background noise, then people on the other end have trouble hearing me.

I wasn't willing to spend $150+ on Airpods, even if I had the money. So i was looking for alternatives, something that was low price, but also good quality. To make sure, I ordered 3 different brands, with similar physical design and similar price point. Used them all for a couple of days, connected to my phone and mac, and this was the only one who worked 100% of the time, regardless of the device connected to, and where both left and right units worked without problems. So i returned the other two and ordered another headset exactly like this. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative than airpods and have similar performance and battery life expectations, I would recommend this brand.
"

I'm still figuring these out. My biggest ""issue"" is that I bought these to run with, but the lowest volume is still fairly loud. They do a great job of noise canceling, so I have to be very attentive on my runs with this combination. They do occasionally lose connection or something because there are gaps in the music flow, but not a big issue for me. Other than that, pretty impressed.

I got it so I could vid call with my long distance bf, but then my dad got me JBL earbuds for the same price (on sale), which are 10000000x better. And now my AIHOOR is back in its box collecting dust. Will give it away soon.Issues with the AIHOOR:1. Connecting to Bluetooth is slow2. Once connected, connection is spotty; audio keeps cutting3. Mic picks up voice poorly; picks up more ambient noise instead4. Audio volume is low5. Touch buttons are too sensitive; moving my hair accidentally touches it6. When I smile, laugh, or eat, the earbuds fall out; bad shape design7. It looks slick and great, but the Asian-accented woman's voice saying ""Bluetooth connected"" is untrendy. JBL's electronic trills are far more classy.Stick with long standing brands like JBL. I can hear the extra $50 difference in audio quality and convenience, and it's absolutely worth it. Not only does the Bluetooth connect smoothly and instantaneously, it comes with an app for even more audio control, perfect if you're a music freak. It also has noise cancelling tech, which is awesome.Would NOT recommend AIHOOR.

I got these on Prime Day and I thought they would be crap. These have actually been life changing. 80% of the time I'm using them while working out, the other 20% is when I can't wear my Bose headphones because it will mess up my hair. The sound quality is solid. The noise cancellation isn't bad either considering how small they are. I've owned these a month and I've charged the battery maybe once. The case is also magnetic so your buds are always secure. Pretty good quality for your buck, even at the full price (I think I got these on sale for $19).

When I first got these earphones, they worked perfectly. The microphone on this device isn't great, but for the price, I thought it was fine. However, after 4 months of using it, the battery has pretty much died. It seems like the case no longer holds any battery: the case dies after less than a single earphone charge and the bluetooth no longer automatically disconnect when I place the earbuds inside the case. Overall, could've been a great earphone but the battery life's just terrible that I can't give it a good rating.

I purchased it in February and used less than 10 times. About a month ago, I realized the ear buds are not lighting up when taken out of the case even though they have been plugged in for more than enough length of time. It seemed like the charging case light never goes to solid which makes me think it is not charging correctly. And probably because of that, it is not being connected with my bluetooth and useless. I sent an inquiry email 5 days ago and didn't get any response. It worked fine while it worked but I didn't expect this to be disposable item and very disappointed.

Great looking red color. I was traveling ,unable to return,One bud works great, the right bud cracks and has static at the weirdest moments.I am still using these ear buds and the crackle noise is still there, but I've upgraded my rating just due to the fact, l rarely never have to charge these,  and wear daily, I'm a  cattle farmer, so I can find them easily if I lose one ( only happened once on the tractor).

The ear buds are made on an angle to place bud in the ear canal while the control bar is outside the ear. It’s very hard to use tapping as a control as it’s dependent on the number of taps and speed of tapping sequence. The left ear controls turning down volume and the right for turning up volume; which doesn’t work if you’re only using one pod obviously. Also when tapping it’s easy to dislodge the pod in your ear causing it to now fall out the ear. For the money, not bad but it’s a middle of the road pricing for a reason
"

These are pretty good. And good for the price. The battery lasts pretty long (I haven’t timed it but I’ve probably already listened about 6 hours since my last charge). They actually do block a lot of noise - I forget it until I take them out on a busy street and am surprised at how loud the world around me is.My only complaints are, they get uncomfortable after a while, like the plastic housing is just too big for my ear. And the touch controls on the side are very sensitive - many times I’ve held my arm over my head to stretch or something and a light tap of my arm on the headphones blasts the sound up. Wish they were tactile buttons.Otherwise, they do the job and do it well.

I like them and dislike them at the same time. The sound quality when listening to music is way better than my AirPods. The battery life goes on forever, not like my AirPods that last about three hours.Now, on to the negative.  I wish the sound was as loud as it is when listening to music.  During calls, I can barely hear anything. I bought them for phone calls, more than anything.  I wonder why they aren’t loud, since music is so LOUD!

For $30 they work better than expected. Maybe not as good audio as my Apple wireless earbuds but for using them at work they are perfect.

Great sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.  Connects easily and touch controls are very responsive.  I bought these three times, and had a somewhat different experience each time though.  With all three, the right earbud's touch control would kind of ""stick,"" resulting in a permanent volume-up input, and after a few seconds the earbud would just power off. This happened about a month after I got each one.  One of the charging cases broke, so now I have to use two earbuds in the same case, and the third pair stopped working altogether so I had to throw it away.  Overall they're nice, but still cheaply made, hence the cost.

I found these uncomfortable in my ear and just not very good quality compared to the 3 other $20-50 range earbuds.  My main earbuds are Jabra Elites and they are exceptional in every way and the cost is 3-5x because you are paying for quality.  I bought these because the Jabras can't connect to Windows laptops which is a frustrating bug that Jabra actually admits to in their help but doesn't fix.  I would suggest trying another low price earbud to these such as TOZO which I had a few years ago and had really good experience with for the price.

Bought these on a whim. Most of the reviews were positive and even more recommended them for small ears. I have never bought into wireless ear buds because they always fall out and the cord would always keep them close by. I love the color of these and the xs buds are the perfect fit. The sound quality is amazing; almost too loud in some cases but I likely just need to turn my volume down!! Highly recommend!!

I Only had earbuds for short period of time, for me they work well.  Have an iPhone 13 pro max and did not want to pay almost 200.00 for apple earpods!  The sound quality is good and easy to setup.  Only wish I had video to show how to tap and change settings.  Product good for the money if you are not an apple guru!

Can’t speak much on battery life since I haven’t used them much, but the sound quality isn’t terrible. It’s pretty good for earbuds and definitely surprised me, although they don’t sound as amazing as my HyperX Cloud Alphas.Bluetooth connection so far has been fine, they sound great :)My pc has bad Bluetooth so anything that gets too far away from it (like 5 feet) gets glitchy/disconnects, and I definitely had that with these too.They have decent noise cancelling, although I feel most earbuds do since you stick them directly in your ears. I think they’re more noise cancelling than my HyperX.That’s all, they are pretty good earbuds. The packaging is nice, only thing of note is they smelled like chemicals. Like bleach kinda, or like they had jsut painted them? Idk. I washed the earbuds (not the actual physical ones, the cover things) and it still smelled a bit strange but I’m assuming that’ll go away over time.In all they’re pretty decent earbuds! I was surprised for the 30$ I got them for.

Decent volume. Not as much Bass as I was expecting based on the description. Good battery life. I easily got 6 hours of podcast and the battery still showed around 50% according to my phone. They're a bit uncomfortable in my ear after a while, but I figure I'll get used to them. I switched out to the smaller silicone fittings.
"

I was skeptical of thesr at first and I decided to get them for work and gym. And I've been using them non stop for the last 4 months. A full charge lasts me two days and I have them on for about 10 hours a day. There have been times where the sound goes in and out but im thinking it's the Bluetooth connection. They're sweat proof. Noise canceling. I usually only do a level 1 sound so one click on my volume and its good enough to cancel noise. These are great. I will probably buy more colors

Sounds quality is nice as the recipient. Everyone I speak with mentions that I sound muffled or they aren't able to hear me clearly. The buds slip out of my ear constantly even with the ability to interchange  the cover size.  It hasn't  been a good experience.  I should return them but I haven't.

These are inexpensive and for the price they are the best, the most reliable I've found. I've had them for 3 months and used them literally every day. There have been a few weird glitches that got fixed when reset. Battery life is great. Noise cancelling isn't amazing but its good. You can use each ear peace independently which is HUGE because even $300+ brands don't do that. The fact that they've lasted 3 months and are still going already makes them better than jabra from a $$ point of view. I'm done with jabra and their headsets that break after 3-6 months for $200-$300 I'll just buy these.

This ear buds work just as well as my brand names ones that I lost.  The sound quality is great.  No need to pay more except the battery life is about 1.5 hours.  They last through my workouts but if need longer battery life might want to get two since so inexpensive.

Right out of the box they paired easily and had a full charge. I'd read the reviews so I was expecting to like them just fine. I was not prepared for the great sound quality however. Very impressed by the high quality sound. Good amount of bass and very loud! I've had ear buds not be loud enough in the past but these are so loud I never put them on max. Very pleased with my purchase!

Now I’m so happy I didn’t spend all that money on the airpod pros the bass in these are superb. Now I must say when I first set it up I must’ve read the instruction wrong but when I finally paired them to my phone the sound quality is amazing. Inexpensive and good quality sounds good to me.
"

I lost one of my apple AirPod pros and bought these as a inexpensive replacement that wouldn’t break the bank if lost. I am pleasantly surprised at the sound quality, ease of use and battery life. My single complaint is if you take them out of your ears there isn’t a sensor to stop the app. Again, this might not be an issue if I hadn’t already experienced how intuitive the apple version are. But apple comes with a steep price that I’m not able to replace. These are serving me well and I have purchased a couple sets to keep in different locations.

I bought these in Jan for a trip. I didn’t want to spend hundreds on a name brand, not knowing if I’d use them much. I am super pleased! They are comfortable and easy to use. For the price I’m thrilled. I even recently had them in my swim shorts pockets and the case and all went for a swim in the pool!!! I figured they would be toast! But, happy to say, they are still working perfectly! I would definitely recommend and purchase again if I needed another pair. The connect easily to my IPhone and my IPad. Battery lasts a long time and the case charges them when stored. I give them 5⭐️

So I have AirPods but of course, lost one and cannot find it. I’m going on a trip soon so having a full set is a must on an international flight (hold up Karen, fully vaxed and boosted before you come for me). These are SO GOOD!!! Set up was easy, instantly paired, and WAY more comfortable than the AirPods. They even come with different size cushion thingys (I’m sure there’s a better technical term) for your ear. Great sound and they stay put. And I was also quite impressed with the packaging! Just as fancy as Apple’s for a fraction of the price. They don’t last quite as long as Apple, but you can just charge them so it’s not a huge deal. Seriously, skip the pods and get these.

These are some of the most portable and long lasting earbuds I have owned. Sound is great for exercise, specifically for running. Also, battery life is most excellent.

I never had a problem with it connecting or losing connection whether indoor or outdoor.

These are grest for the money. However i have long hair and sometimes my hair touching the touch ckntrols pauses or skips and even adjusts the volume. That may be just my case but thought the sensitivity was worth mentioning. J have also struggled to get one or the other to pair. Lately ive only been able to get one or the other to pair up and play music. Still figuring it out. Either way a decent purchase and worth the fair price.

I bought these for travel and they are everything I wanted! The case is small and magnetized so they ear buds snap right in and don’t rattle around. They come with four sizes of ear pieces so you can find the right fit. The sound is great and the noise cancelling is surprisingly good!

When I first got these headphones, I was a little confused by the touch-sensitive sides.  I kept accidentally hitting them and pausing/unpausing my audiobooks.  I even left a 2-star review over what I thought was a malfunction.After a few days of use, however, I got used to the buttons, and they're pretty intuitive once you know they're there.  I appreciate that I can both rewind and fast forward Audible by double-tapping the left or right side, and control the volume by holding them.  The buttons are still a little oversensitive, and you have to be careful not to touch them while taking the earbuds out and/or putting them away.

Pleasantly suprise with these for the price I spent. Got them on a lightening deal and haven't been disappointed.  The sound is clear and loud. My 13 year old son said I should've just got air pods but I'm fine with these for what I need them for.  They stay in my ear 99% of the time....they fell out a couple times while I was moving around a lot with a beanie on, but it was only a couple times. I think the hardest part is figuring out where and how to tap to control the volume, turn on/off, etc

These are my first set of wireless ear pods. I was a little confused when first setting them up but once I figured that out they seem to work great. So far I have no complaints.

These things blew me away. Are they perfect - no, but are the good - yes, especially for $20 (got a pair on sale) or $30 (The one's I got for my son). I would definitely recommend, especially if you lose them on any regular basis (I do apparently).

I didn’t think I was going to like them. They stay in my ear and the sound is so clear. The battery life is not long though. But once you charge in the case for a little bit , you are good to go. And it is a great price! I would definitely buy again.

I've never liked ear buds and they tend to hurt and annoy me when I wear them for more than an hour or so.  These are very comfortable, and I can (and have) actually forget I have them in.  Sound quality is significantly better than I was expecting.  The product advertises a 15 hour battery life.. I think maybe they added 7.5 hours per ear bud together, because that seems to be about the charge life on them.  Still very happy with the product and going to purchase another pair for my partner when she gets her new phone.
"
1232,"
Since I already have a pair of Apple Airpods Pros(gift), which only come in white, I decided to give these a try. The only thing that really concerned me when I purchased them was if they would hold up to my intense workouts. I have owned many different brands that say they are ip67(waterproof), but they usually don't live up to the hype. I have used these regularly for about a month and so far they have been great. The sound quality is good and they never fail to connect with my iPhone. I would definitely recommend these.-Happy Trails

I work on my feet half the day and drive the other half. These earbuds live up to the description and last all day. The foam type insert sits comfortably in my ears, I couldn't use the plastic/rubber type as they would start hurting after a few hours. I have no discomfort with these. And, they were a great price. These work just as goid as the top of the line brands in my experience. I would recommend this product.
"
1236,"
The battery life is great on these and if I’m sitting somewhere not moving they work great but what’s the point of having wireless if you don’t move. I take these when I go out for a walk and any wind will make one stop working and when I get a phone call I’ve had my call hang up several times when using these when it has never happened when I don’t use them, sometimes the call comes through on them, sometimes I can’t hear anything and have to use my phone and half the time after a call I can’t get them connected to my music again.  If I don’t get any calls and there’s no wind they work fine but I guess you get what you pay for.

Great sound, they look very stylish but they keep dropping from my ears, I use the earbuds mainly to workout at the gym and these ones apparently are too small they keep falling from my ear while I’m working out so I think they’re not good for the gym or to exercise, another thing I don’t love is the fact that they’re so sensitive that just by touching them they stop, so I I touch them by accident while I’m at the gym the music or whatever I’m listening will automatically stop.

When I first put these in my ears after charging them they did have a very good sound. They’re super touchy though so if you’re moving them around in your ears and you hit them they can go out of sync now I cannot get them back into sync no matter what I do have followed the instructions have looked up a YouTube video and they just will not pair up again to each other. Only one gets sound or the other gets sound But not at the same time. I was going to return them but I’m waiting for the battery to die so that I can see if when I charge them again I can get them both working together and try to keep my fingers away from the areas that change things.

The sound is fine, the battery life is ok, and they look similar to ipods, but they are so sensitive to touch and movement that they turn off, pause, or the volume increases/lowers at the slightest movement. Don’t brush your hair aside - you’ll turn them off. Don’t scratch your ear, or move your head too fast either! Constant interruptions to play at normal, light movements seems like a design flaw. Affordable, yes, but I only use them if the battery runs out on my other ones now. Too annoying to use.

The sound is great but that's about it. I couldn't find a size of the rubber ear buds that fit comfortably in my ears and weirdly the two ear buds fit differently. The left is wonky and the right is fine. The instructions regarding volume, muting, pausing seemed easy enough but it hasn't been the case. It's rare I am able to pause my music and all it seems to do is raise the volume. Not as pleased as I thought I would be. It shouldn't be this complicated.
"

I was really excited for these and really wish that I could have left a positive review, because I loved the way they looked and the packaging was nice and sleek... First problem, I have small ears which these advertise for. Unfortunately they did not work for me, while in my ears they felt fine, nice and secure like they wouldn't come out. But after taking them out my ears felt very sore, and this is after putting in the XS ear piece, and would eventually slip out of my ear after some time. Second problem, if I wanted to connect to a specific device like my laptop I had to ensure that my bluetooth was turned off on any other device that these things are paired with. If I didn't it would randomly connect to different devices. Third and final issue was the battery life. I work in an office and tried to use these for meetings on Teams, one ear bud would die within 5 minutes of the meeting, after being charged all night and not used until the meeting, and the other would die part way through the meeting... Save yourself the headache and look at different earbuds.

Fit is fantastic! I can shake my head, head-bang, jump around, and they stay put! The sound quality is far better than expected, just as good as more expensive pairs. Easily connects via Bluetooth, works instantly on my Samsung phone. I feel like I am in a personal bubble with these on! I was disappointed by my phone brand's simlar product, but these are cheaper and work better for me by far! Highly recommend!

These are the best off brand AirPods. I charged them when I first opened the package and have not had to plug them in again for 3 weeks now. The pink is so cuts! The earbuds never fall out of my ears and do not get uncomfortable at all. The only down side is that you have to get used to the sensitive touch commands but after a few days, it becomes normal!

I’ve had these headphones for 3 months now and I regret buying them. I got them because of a lightning deal but they are more trouble than what they’re worth. They connect well but after 10 minutes on a call, all I get is static and too much feedback. If I use these close to my computer, the static gets worse. The other person can’t hear me and I hear them with a static break every other word.I’ve reset the connection multiple times and I’m still having issues.

Saw these being all cheap and thought, eh, let's see.Holy crap they are amazing xD I don't understand how the apple ones are so expensive if you can make these for under thirty bucks.

They’re good headphones and have surprising range.  Take time to find the ear piece that’s the right fit for you.  They’re touchy, so be patient, they’re going to skip, pause or turn off when you adjust them with your hand.  Great product for the price overall though. Would recommend. 👌

For the price can't be beat I use these in place of my apple earbuds pro at work out of fear of potential loss and find the quality, sound and functionality on par. Only drawback between the two is the fit in the case, the buds are more difficult to remove and place back in the case, for the price worth the hassle.

The battery life isn't as good as I think it should be. I only wear one ear bud at a time so when I get the Low battery message I can put that one in the charger and use the charged bud. The real problem is the ear buds fall out of my ears. I need to find something else.

Uncomfortable for small ears. But overall, a pretty good earbuds

These are ok but are definitely not for small ears. The sound is good for the price but they do not stay in your ears while exercising or household chores. If you are looking for earbuds that stay put and you have small ears I would pass on these.

Sound is great no complaints there….they are not very comfortable even with diff sized ear silicon pieces.

They may not have some of the fancy features that airpods have but they stay in my ear very well for that style and have the best battery life, volume, and sound quality combo at this price point and I have tried many Bluetooth headphones ranging up over the $100 mark.

I use this on a job site, I get them very dirty. I have been using them for months now 8 hours a day listening to music.

Easily comparable to the Apple Air pods in quality.

I purchased these headphones because I couldn’t originally afford airpods. These headphones are not only comfortable, but have excellent sound quality and works wonderfully with running. I often use them during class, and they work wonders on canceling out unwanted noise. Not to mention, their sleek appearance makes them look just like airpods, but truly runs more comfortable!
"

They worked great for about 3 months. Sound quality was perfect, they were easy to connect and disconnect to my phone, they were great. Then things started going downhill the beginning of June. At first it was just an occasion cutting in and out of music; not ideal but not a huge problem. Then they started connecting and disconnecting at random from my phone. Again, not a big deal, but a bit annoying. Then this morning I plugged them in to charge, and less than 2 hours later heard a pop and smelled melted plastic to find they had exploded and melted to my counter. The charger is melted inside the case and the case is melted shut, but luckily it didn’t start a fire in my outlet. Maybe I got a defective pair, but I just wanted others to know in case it happened to anyone else.

Every time I get a call, it is difficult to turn them on and I hang up on the caller.  To hear on my iPhone I then have to go to settings to undo pairing, or I still cannot talk to my caller.  By the time I get it set up the caller has moved on and are not available.  What a waste of my money.  The only positive I found was the liners come in a bunch of sizes.
"
1322,"
Affordable, comfortable, batteries last a long time and are easily re-chargeable, bluetooth pairing is a snap and they have good sound quality. But when used with a hearing app the latency (sound delay) makes them almost useless. This is a common problem, apparently, with bluetooth ear phones.ok for listening to music or pod casts. Haven’t tried it with telephone calls yet.

After using for a few months, I’m searching for new headphones. What I like: great sound, easy to set up. Don’t  like: Too big. Painful after an hour of use. Touch controls are too sensitive. If I adjust the fit, the song will pause or change volume.

I didn't mind the plastic feeling of the case or headphones. I didn't care for the accent of the headphone's narrator telling you that it's on, off, searching or disconnected. But what I did mind was that only 1 headphone works great at any given time.I needed headphones for my surface laptop. It already has a Bluetooth connection with its pen and keyboard. When I use 1 headphone, it works!But as soon as I put on both headphones at once, the sound quality gets choppy! I assume this is because it has a weak Bluetooth connection that gets scrambled once you put on both headphones. So, if your device has many connections to it, don't be surprised if it scrambles the audio of this cheap headphone.

"

Overall, good value for money. The only negative is that the volume for device prompts (""pairing"", ""connecting"", etc.) is way too loud -- I have to remember to hold the earbuds an inch or two away from my ears so that they don't blast my eardrums every time I switch between devices.Update 1: It's been just over six months and these earbuds do not power down and/or recharge properly when put back in the charging case.Update 2: Manufacturer was very prompt in sending a replacement set  -- faulty set was still under warranty. Hopefully, the replacement will last longer. Upgrading to 3 stars for excellent service.
"
1342,"
These buds are a nice sound quality. Good bass tones and clear highs. The sensors for pause and skip could be a little more sensitive. My biggest dislike is the charging case has no indication telling you what percentage your cases battery life is or any indication that your buds are actively charging. I have a set of veatol buds that don’t sound as nice but the case and charging system is better.

"

The Bluetooth connection is great and sound quality is relatively good, my only suggestions are that it could use better noise cancellation, and play louder. I would also like to mention battery life. The battery life of the individual ear buds are poor. I do not understand why one or both earbuds will cut out or ""power off"" shortly after a overnight charge (assuming 7/8 hours is plenty for full charge). With this being said, when comparing products with both quality and cost I wouldn't expect a nearly $30 product to match a $130 pair of air pods. Although I would like to have better reason to choose it over wired earbuds.
"

It was great for about 3 months using about 30 minutes per day. One earbud stopped charging, I wrote the company, and they sent me a brand new unit. So I am incredibly surprised at how awesome their customer support is. I think that my issue was an anomaly. It’s a good device.

This is my first set of earbuds and I love them.  Of course, it's not like having an orchestra in my head. But the sound quality for both music and phone conversation is great.  I like that I can use them and have my iPhone on the charger.  They connect immediately after removing them from the nice case.  I used them on a plane 2 1/2 hours each way and they still were over 2/3 charged.I recommend these for ease of use and decent sound.
"
1376,"
The control on the earbud itself isn’t an actual button; Its touch controlled, so just adjusting the headphone back into your ear turns the sound off or even powers down. Then you have to put back in the case and pull back out to power on effectively which isn’t very user friendly when you’re breastfeeding your newborn to sleep and listening to podcasts. Sound quality is average, battery life is average, wouldn’t order again.
"
1377,"
I really like these because of their small size and how comfortable they are in your ear. I noticed that when I was listening with only one earbud in and then I wanted to use the other one as well, the other one was not connecting.

It was good according to the price. But the sound quality doesn't match with the video.

Very nice headphones for the budget price...Great sound, easy pairing, comfortable to wear and great battery life. Unfortunately, the controls are terrible. No matter how you try to single tap, double tap etc they never do what you want. Anytime I try to advance to the next song, the tap either pauses (supposed to be a single tap) or tries to open Google assistant doesnt skip to the next song. Then when I do try to pause with a single tap, it advances to the next song. Unfortunately, this is really a pain as the whole point of headphones like this is to be able to control your phone with a few simple taps vs having to take your phone out of your pocket or wherever it may be. Too bad they couldnt make this work the way it should, which I have found seems to be a common issue with these budget wireless ""pods""UPDATE. Seller reached out to me offering a replacement. Provided my address per their request but replacement never arrived.

These sound as good or better then my $150 wired dual driver ear buds. Wish I'd found these first. New issue is after three weeks of vacation, these no longer work correctly, the left earbud is dead, will not factory reset like the youtube videos show. Lights up when returned to the case but won't recover after charging overnight, won't recover after repeated reset attempts. The left earbud is just dead, to bad I really liked the sound and fit.
"
1437,"
I got these for work and if so listened to only one earbud at a time, it would last my six hour shift which seems pretty normal. However, if I ever used them on a walk, they would go in and out and almost ‘skip’, whereas my husband’s earbuds (not this brand) would not do this when I used them. Additionally they just randomly stopped playing sound in them last week. Fully charged, fully connected, they even play the ‘connected’ sound and show connected to my phone, they just do not play sound any longer. Really unfortunate, would definitely not purchase again.

Pros: The sound quality is pretty good. They’re comfortable and stay in my ears. Cons: I can no longer get both ear buds to sync. Only one will play. Very frustrating. The “controls” on them are sensitive and don’t work properly. The battery only lasts about 6 hours. Not the 30 that’s claimed.

First time buying wireless earbuds and with these , I was not disappointed. Sound was very clear and the the noise level very good. The charge last a long time.

These earbuds are pretty good for a cheap price. They have great sound quality but not great with noise cancellation. Even though the earbuds are made for small ears, I still have trouble having them stay in. I wish they could be turned up louder too for someone who is hard of hearing it’s difficult to be able to hear the music properly. Overall they are great and last a long time without charging.

Served its purpose. Battery life not so long, though  the noise cancellation is where I want it....I can hear the speaker and my surroundings still. Sometimes cell can' t utilize (Bluetooth), but when it does, it works fine.

The earbuds was too big for me.  On your future product or existing one should state the size, since there are customers out there that has a small earlobes

I’m always nervous to buy technology products that I’ve never heard of, but this one was not a regret! Especially for this price. The sound quality is great- way better than I imagined. I read some previous comments about how some people hate how the headphones are touchy, but I don’t mind it- I think it’s extremely convenient you control volume, change tracks, etc. They do fit a little big in my ear, but I typically don’t leave them in for an extended period of time for it to bother me.
"

I haven't used a lot, and not using for music. Can't figure out how to increase the volume, as trying to use them with my phone to talk to family member on the way home. Still trying to figure it out. Even with different size tips, seems to be a bit big for my ears. No way I would be able to run and think these will stay in.

I like how they feel in my ear, they are very comphy and they don't feel too deep. I just wish they would stay in a little better. I think over all they are a wonderful product just think they need to have an over the ear back piece to make help them stay in a little bit better.

These are my first pair of wireless earbuds and so far so good. I wasn’t looking to spend a lot of money and these are everything I was looking for and didn’t break my wallet.

I wanted to like these, but I have super small ears, apparently, and even on the smallest rubber nub thing the buds will not nestle in my ears. There is no quality sound, nothing close to noise cancelling sound and I’m constantly having to adjust, push the bud or buds back into my ears multiple times when wearing them. Bought them to use while working out (low impact) and I regret having spent the money. I’m beyond the return window or I would return these and attempt to find a product to fit my needs and my ears.

Sound is good. The side buttons are super sensitive and accidentally pause/unpause all the time. It’s super annoying when I lose track of where I am in my audiobook because I put them in my pocket for a minute.

Hasta ahora no he tenido problemas con la carga de la batería. El sonido está bastante bien, emparejan fácil con cualquier dispositivo. El micrófono no es tan bueno, las personas te escuchan como dentro de un cuarto con eco y un poco lejos. De resto todo muy bien, llegan muy bien empacados, viene con opciones de diferentes tamaños para ajustar los auriculares al oído. Hay que fijarse en cerrar el bluetooth del dispositivo para desconectar correctamente los audífonos cuando se regresan al estuche.
"

UPDATE: While I loved these earbuds, the left one started to go out. I tried everything in the FAQs and manual, and finally I emailed their customer service...twice. Haven't received a response. I'm extremely disappointed that they couldn't even email me back.I must have weird ear holes because no ear buds are comfortable- except these. I jog with these and they stay put and don't bother me at all. My only complaint is that if I readjust them for any reason, I bump the pause button. Honestly though, these are fantastic. They also charge quickly and hold a charge.

Main reason I returned these - Product page describes that as ""designed for small ears"" but they are extremely painful for my smaller ears.Secondary reason I returned - Would not stay in my ears while sitting in my office chair.  I would not trust them to stay in on a bike ride, bus ride, or even a walk.  They also no not come with any other ear cushions of different sizes and the material used is very flimsy compared to other in ear headphones I have used.Last reason I returned - tap controls as horrible.  Volume is not one of the controls available.  Volume can only be controlled from the phone/playback device.  Of the remaining controls, there is noticeable lag from when tapped before the action takes place.  This makes it difficult to know if it worked or if another tap is needed and can cause play/pause turn into next/previous track, or next/previous track to turn into voice assistant.  Or the worst, answer call turns into dismiss call.

I am aware that these are not noise-canceling earbuds. However, I was not prepared to be able to hear absolutely everything when I am listening to music at a decent volume while wearing these. If you want your earbuds to be able to block even a little noise while you're listening, do not buy these. The battery life also isn't great - about 5 hours at a low to medium volume.

They also connect rather easily once connected to bluetooth!

Mainly, they don't fit so I constantly have to push them back into the right position. This is causes them to turn off. Then randomly i'll pull them both out of the case and one will just turn it self off completely. So i have to put it back in and take it out to turn the earbud back on. People can't hear me that well either and that's bad because I'm LOUD. Other than that the sound quality is pretty good. And people can't hear what you're doing.

Hurts my ears even with the smallest ear Bud
"
1595,"
Poor sound quality and only worked ""right"" for a week, then the sound started cutting out like every 5 seconds which is agitating. I didn't notice any type of noise cancelation. Then the left stopped charging right and when I would use both together the left would force the volume of both all the way down, then power off the left one only. Aside from that they are hard to get in and out of the case because the squared shape of the stems and they are too short to grip easily. I bought them because the reviews were mostly good but that wasn't my experience with them. They are going back right now.

After less than a month of use (at tops, 3 hours per day) the ear pieces stop connecting all the way. Only one ear piece would connect at a time. I tried everything to get them to connect together again with no luck.Thankfully I didn't spend a lot of money on these because they are cheaply made.

I gave these three stars based off the color which matches my iPhone. Other than that I wasn't impressed. The headphone controls are too sensitive and at times I found myself skipping songs when I wanted to pause or turning up the volume when I simply wanted to adjust the placement of the earbud. Also there are too many control and light options to remember to signify battery life, Bluetooth connect etc. Keep it simple. I returned these.

I read & researched & the product description was impressive.  HOWEVER, I attempted to use these buds, only 3x. I use buds to focus on my workout. The Right bud first did not work at all, so, I charged it more. Then, it worked and kept shutting off. After wearing these buds for less than 15 minutes, a strange, annoying sounds come from both buds, that I am 'fear' of doing some SERIOUS audio/ear damage, from the buds!!!! SCARY.  I WILL BE RETURNING THIS ITEM, SADLY THEY DON'T WORK.-L
"

I like these because it is great sound quality  that I can listen my music while working! Very convenient!
"
1610,"
Simply put, the buds won't pair after just a few months from purchase and with minimal use. Item was used less than an hour a week for a few month, maybe 20 hours total and then they simply stopped pairing. I can get sound out of only one bud, sometimes the left, usually the right, but never both. I spent 2 hours trying to fix the issue before concluding that they were fubar.That's only the half of it. From day one, they would lose connection briefly in either the right or left bud depending on which pocket I had my phone. Phone on the left, the right bud would skip, phone on the right, the left bud would skip. The skipping occurred about once every song or two and lasted less than a second. I had to hold my phone out in front of me to avoid skipping. Note that my phone connects to my car, my friend's car and my home PC Bluetooth without issue.Finally, I can connect other buds to my phone without problem and encountered the same lack of pairing when trying to connect the Aihoor with a friend's phone. Result: These buds are worth about $1 max, anything more is a rip-off. A pair of tin cans connected via string produces more reliable sound.
"
1611,"
They work well.
"
1612,"
Sounds is good. Easy to operate. BUT, the sound does not completely match the picture. The sound is a fraction behind the lips, when watching someone talking/singing. I tried to reconnect, reboot, restart, reeverything.I guess you go get what you pay for. I’ll just use them for listening to music when I work out.

The product works well when it works, but it will not last very long at all.  I have had two of them since july of 2022.  The first one's left bud never worked and I received a replacement.  The second one worked for about 3 months and now the left one has a battery time of about 10 minutes.Do not waste your money.

I bought these so that I could use them with my motorcycle, but they did not work well with a helmet. They would shut off during my trips, which meant I needed to stop alongside the road to figure out what was going on. After just a few weeks, the left earbud stopped working all together.
"
1621,"
El producto suena muy bien, la batería está, bien, muy sensible al tocarlos, pero es cuestión de familiarizarnos con los toques , muy bien gracias
"
1622,"
It's an okay product. The sound quality is good, but having finger-print buttons is inconvenient. When I adjust the headphone in my ear I always accidentally push them and pause what I'm listening to. Also, I can only use one at a time for work. So having a layout where each headphone button has different functions is not useful to me and hard to navigate. Again, not a terrible product, but these are things to consider.
"
1623,"
I’ve only had them for a couple of months and the right earbud no longer works! Up until now they’ve  worked fine. Of course it’s beyond the return policy days so I’ll be looking for a different brand next time.
"

Was hoping for a better outcome. No one can hear me talk when I use them. Which is a need for me, whole point of earbuds. Can still hear my neighbors fighting, noise canceling isn't a thing. Only thing that is nice about these. Battery does hold a charge
"

I lost my first pair of these, which i HAD LOVED.The pair I bought this time around doesn't last long (like maybe an hour), doesn't charge well, and the sound starts and stops randomly.Super disappointed and wish I could find my first pair. :*(

I've never had wireless buds before but took a chance.  Once you get used to the # of taps to make it work it has been fabulous.  Working, walking, or just relaxing, it's nice to move around and not have to open my phone every time to listen to music or talk on the phone.
"
1627,"
I mostly use these earbuds when I watch videos on my phone and answering phone calls. Works great so far. The battery lasts about 5 hours, which is a big plus. Only downside is a poor bass sound when I listen to music. But other than that, these earbuds are worth for the money.
"
1628,"
I actually like the product and works well in a quiet environment. Unfortunately I live and work on a busy traffic street and my clients cannot hear me.Sound is good for listening to music.Beware!

The earbuds are ok at best, if you use one at a time you can get a total of 8 hrs 4 hours each nothing beyond that, so that’s misleading they are very sensitive so be careful with touching them, I will not recommend because I don’t feel they are worth the money

When I can use them, I like them. I have used them once with my phone for music while I'm doing whatever and twice I have gotten them to work for the reason I purchased them. I bought them to use with my Switch because the volume doesn't work in handheld mode. Here is where my major issue comes in. For every 10 times I try to connect to the device, it will connect once if I'm lucky. I will get it ready, hit connect on the Switch and as its searching, the ear bud will say connected. WTH is it connected to!!?? Certainly not my device. Complete waste of money. Now I have to buy a different set in hopes that I won't have the same issue. While yes they are nicely inexpensive, I could have gotten farther putting that money in my gas tank then it has benefited me to use these.

These earbuds were a great purchase… in the beginning… around 3 months later, one ear bud started going in and out on sound. It would connect but there was no sound. Shortly thereafter, it quit working all together. Only one earbud works as of today. So I guess you get what you pay for and although I thought the reviews were great, the longevity was no good. Back to spend more time and money on finding a better pair of earbuds… ugh!!!

I tried several times, but had little to no success.  The devices work as a pair, but when I got them connected to bluetooth, there were two separate connections. As a result, one side would work or the other, but never as a pair, so no stereo.  Tried several times to reset but got the same result when trying to pair them.  Very frustrating.  I tried their tech support chat, but I'm not going to install their software to do a chat.  Documentation is a joke - you need a magnifier.  I'm returning them.

I bought these after reading the piles of positive reviews. I wish I had just glanced at the 1 star reviews, maybe I would have hesitated to purchase them.While charging, these earbuds ignited and caused a lot of damage. They were smoking and sparking when we found them and had already melted the screen of a nearby phone and tablet. We are INCREDIBLY lucky they did not start a major house fire. If we had found them 10 or 20 minutes later, our kitchen would have been in flames. Our house still reeks of melted plastic. It's a nightmare. Electronics should have basic fail-safes to prevent overheating and fire. These do not. Spend a little more money or go with a different company. Do not risk fire with these crappy little earbuds. Not worth it.

I don’t usually write reviews but I am for this product. The headphone were great but only lasted a couple months. The wiring when you put the headphone into the charge sucks. It bent I guess and now only the r side will charge and it’s annoying to listen with only one side working. There’s no way to reach into the charging area to fix it so now I’m out of luck. Buying a different brand next time.

Only problem I’ve had with these ear buds is when they get to the halfway battery life every 2 minutes it says low battery. Other than that they work good.

These actually stay in my ears which is a giant plus.  But the battery life is a major disappointment.  I get 2.5 to 3 hours per charge.  It’s definitely not enough to last the day.

Hard to use the functions, they feel loose in my ears. If I press them in harder so they feel secure, they actually end up being quite painful after a short while. Would not recommend

It would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact it sometimes randomly disconnects. And I have to go through a long series of steps just to get it to reconnect. Not to mention NOT GOOD FOR PHONE CALLS. I'm always getting complaints that the sound quality of the mic is bad or that it's muffled.UPDATE: 8 months later the left ear bud stopped working. I've had cheaper wireless earbuds that lasted for 3 years and this didn't even make it to a year.

Design isn't great. They easily slip out of my ears. They shut off daily for no reason (I have to put them back in their container to reset them). There are better buds out there for just $10 more.

Won’t disconnect from my phone when placed in case unless I press them in hard. They will still reconnect randomly minutes later. I’m also having trouble getting the right side to charge now. Guess the 10 year olds this company uses for production aren’t quite strong enough to snap the case together. Do not under any circumstances buy this product.

I read the previous reviews and thought I’d give these earbuds a shot for a backup pair.  The price was awesome on a lightening deal. Packaging was really nice and I had high hopes that they buds were going to be good.Well- to be honest, these buds are awful. With the sound all the way up the sound was thin and with no extra bass to help round out the song.I can’t say anything on the noise cancellation features or the battery life.  The buds were returned the same day they arrived.

The single, double and triple tap controls work about 10% of the time, if even. There is no way to adjust the amount of bass in the headphones either. For some, that bass is nice, but all the time? Nah. Phone calls are also not as loud as music, which is a major let down. I don't know why this is, but some calls are loud and some are not - despite raising the volume up. Even for $30 these just aren't worth it. The magnetic case and clip INS are a nice touch, but I need the headphones to work.

These headphones are pretty nice for the price however they aren’t really supportive and effective. I’m using the smallest ear bud sponge and they still feel chunky in my ears & the sound only feels elevated when they’re shoved deep inside your ear. The final straw for me is that felt that it constantly hangs up my phone calls if I touch them by accident and won’t always work for calls.  I had higher hopes of these based on other reviews but…. Kind of disappointed.

Do not buy these headphones. They are terrible.Especially if you are a user of IOS avoid these headphones at all cost. You can’t connect both headphones at the same time. To turn off or turn on you have to use some fingerprint sensor because they didn’t add a button which is terrible. IOS won’t let you pair two devices simultaneously so even if they say both devices are connected you can’t play them at the same time. It is even more terrible that you have to connect them individually and they can’t just both be using the same Bluetooth connection. The sound is decent I’ll give it that but the rest of it is poorly designed and this product you be taken off of Amazon permanently so you people don’t have to suffer like I did. These earbuds are pieces of garbage. I rest my case.

I bought these headphones for work.  I'm in meetings all day and wanted wireless headphones for WebEx calls on my laptop.  They did not work.  Initially the sounds was very fuzzy.  I contacted customer service they advised me to pair/unpair and reset the headphones.  I did this then only one headphone worked.  I tried to fix this many times to no avail.  They are going back. I don't know how they work with a phone but I would not recommend using with a laptop.

The battery life for these ear buds is astonishingly short.  The right ear is flaky with audio going in and out. They sometimes just spontaneously turn off at the end of a podcast. The case lid doesn't open all the way so getting the ear buds in and out of the case is a pain.

i rarely write reviews for things but the build on this is so flimsy and cheap-feeling (have bought other earbuds in this range that feel better quality/more sturdy-built) and the audio quality is actively horrible – overwhelming bass that is buzzy and muddles the rest of the sound too

The sound was decent for the price with a nice battery life. That is where the pros end. The touch controls while easy to use are very touchy. The case doesn’t open very far so you have to pinch and be careful to not snap off the lid. The main drawback is the shape of the earbuds, they have this shape that presses uncomfortably into your ear when you try to put them in.
"
1868,"
Ever wonder what the difference between expensive and cheap wireless earbuds is? This product, that’s what! I have bad tinnitus in both ears and bought these so I could listen to music while I fall asleep. As I turns out you have to spend at least 15-20 minutes trying to get the earbuds to connect via Bluetooth and then even if they do connect, they disconnect after a few minutes. So unless you’re looking to become and stay frustrated every time you want to use earbuds, skip these. This product proves that spending the extra money for a quality product is worth it to ensure devices connect as they should. Next time I’ll just give the $30 to the neighbor kids to waste on slurpees and hot dogs at the gas station since at least some joy will come out of it.

I bought the earbuds.  I liked them.  However, after about three hours of playing and even answering a short phone call, they started to make static noise and then stopped working.Worse, though, they caused the lighting on my phone screen to turn so dark it was almost unreadable.I had to make guesses on the dark screen to remember where the settings button and the display button is on my phone so that I could make my phone screen visible again.Today, I decided to try the earbuds again.  Unfortunately, they would not come on at all.  I am returning them.

These buds are advertised as having really good bass capability. Well, they don't. In fact, the bass is really poor.

I've never left a bad review from any of my purchases on Amazon, even when my keyboard came without a flash drive. Just be careful when you buy these ear pods.After feeling so excited and raving about these ear pod, I realized that the battery case is totally faulty. I found this out after the 2nd purchase. The 1st purchase lasted about a month and a half. I figured that it was a faulty ear pod (right). I made the 2nd purchase, and the left ear pod went out. I tried the left ear pod from the 1st purchase, which it worked, and it didn't work in the battery case of the 2nd purchase. They seem to have a life span of 45 days. What a hassle.

I don’t know what headphones these people got in the other reviews but these headphones are not it. I’ll start this by saying I have an iPhone so I cannot speak for how it works on android. First off, pairing this was hard asf. It took me multiple tries. The headphones kept saying “turning off” and this is with it being fresh out the box. When I finally got it paired, it kept disconnecting. The sound quality is not good, it sounds muffled. If you want to be heard clearly when speaking, talk loud and clear. Definitely not worth to me and I just got them and only have had them for less than 30 minutes. Seems like AirPods would be better and worth its expense. Sometimes cheaper isn’t better.

I bought a pair of these to Bluetooth into my Laptop for gaming. I play in sessions that run for 3-4 hours. Without fail, every game, these start to die after 90 minutes.

I read a lot of the reviews before the purchase. A lot said sound quality was good. Personally I all probably stay with my wire ear buds. Because the volume doesn’t seem to be loud enough I can hear people in the room and the base is non existent. Poor choice/decision by me.
"

Randomly disconnects every half hour or so and can only be resolved by putting the buds back in the cradle to power off, and then reconnecting. Exactly what you want to have to do while on a run, on an exercise bike, whike driving etc... They're just trash.EDIT: eventually after a time, they began turning themselves on randomly inside the cradle, and disconnecting me from the headphones I was actively using. The only solution to this problem was to smash these garbage earbuds between to concrete cinder blocks.
"
1927,"
Falls out and everytime you touch it, stops playing music, if you touch it again nothing. Tap it 20 times it will start music again..runner? Good luck, They will fall out every 2 mins and you can tell because the music sounds crappier, they are so far away from your ear drum as they will fall soon and you will never find them for a long time. So annoyed by this model..through them in the garbage.

I had these for a week. The first time I used them my phone paired fine with both ear buds. But now when I try to use them it will only pair to one of them.

Let me start off by saying I don’t leave bad reviews. If something is wrong I just return them and am done with it. But I feel very strongly to the point where I have to right a review. This item has great ratings! So I was expecting something of quality. In reality, the headphones constantly hang up the phone without me pressing it down for 2 seconds as the description says, does not last more than 2 hours before dying even after a full charge when I was looking forward to the long battery life it claims and the noise cancellation is nonexistent. Maybe I was unlucky and got a defective pair but I’m very disappointed in them in general.

If you only like hearing your music intermittently out of one ear at a time these headphones are just the thing for you.They play with below quality sound in one ear at a time (kindly giving your other ear a little rest) …. But watch out if you happen to turn your head even the slightest the tricky headphones will still only play out of one ear but switch back and fourth for a few seconds before deciding which ear (only one) deserves music.

These buds are not user friendly. Everytime I touch it barely it shuts off. Noise quality is poor for the price compared to the pair I had before of similar cost (I could not find again). One bud never works and I cant figure out why.  Not Impressed. Do not reccommend.

These headphones were a huge disappointment. The noise canceling feature is not good at all. If I'm around noise at work the person I'm talking to complains that it sounds like I'm underwater or in the shower. I've had other headphones that were cheaper that did a much better job.

The battery life does not last long. Every 2 minutes they disconnect and then connect. It says disconnecting/connecting every 2 minutes in your ear. I read it could be when it’s a low battery but even fully charged they don’t stay connected and it’s hard for people to hear you

I was excited to see that this product looked really nice when it arrived, and sounded good too. I used them for a day and a half and then left them to charge and after about an hour they suddenly exploded into a fireball off of my desk. Freaked me the hell out, but thankfully I wasn’t hurt and nothing else caught fire. I got the fire out but that was scary as hell.This might have been a one off, but it’s too big of a risk for me!

Sound quality is no where near the less sleek (but way less expensive) Otium I have.  Lose connection in one bud or another randomly, and wind up skipping songs, etc, due to movement.  Mediocre at best.
"

From the start, the left earbud was continuously dropping volume and turning off. When I tried to get some support, I was told I was wearing them wrong. One day, I wouldn't have any problem with them. More common is the experience I had just now wherein I tried for a half an hour to get the left earbud to actually work, and every time it turned on, dropped the volume, and powered off.The effort is not worth it, and I'll be buying a different set. The sound quality is good, but this is such a pain it's not worth the irritation.

These paired perfectly with my iPhone (and several other friends' iPhones and Android phones). I was testing them on different phones because the first pair became full of static and sound bounced right to left and cut out when I went for a walk with my phone in my pocket.I exchanged the first pair thinking maybe it was a tech. fluke. But the 2nd pair did the exact same thing with any phone. Sitting by the pool they were great. But connection cuts out constantly even when I was holding my phone in my hand while walking. Two thumbs way down.

The ear piece is too big. They provide different sizes of ear pieces, but they are all super uncomfortable to the point I feel like I’m underwater. The sound quality is definitely 25 bucks worth. And don’t you dare try and adjust them, because you might change the volume drastically. Definitely pay a few more bucks for a better product.Edit: I’ve been trying to make these work. The ear pieces are too big and fall out of my ear. I’ll touch them to push them back in… because they are touch sensitive, it’ll pause what I’m playing or change the volume. 🤦🏻‍♀️

The problem with theae earbuds was the uncomfort. Nome of the buds fit my ears, thus continued ro fall out.  For instances, the right earbud was lostt because it fell out and I didn't notice it..NOW I HAVE TO BY A NEW PAIR.!!SO ALL IN ALL I DISLIKE THIS PRODUCT.

Most times I take the ear phones out of the box and put them on, only one of them connects automatically and I'll have to take both off, put them back in the box, toggle bluetooth on/off on my phone and try again hoping for a good connection.

At first, they were ok.. then, after a few weeks, the right bud won’t take a charge, reliably.  I’ve cleaned contacts, but that did not fix.  Also, the BT connection is glitchy/noisy when moving around in  “urban” areas.  Fine in stationary location.  Waste of money….

These headphones are great honestly, much better then any AirPod. But they do cut out sometimes & that’s only when you have the volume up more than half way.

These are probably the earbuds that have fit me the best out of all the ones that I have tried but the sound quality is just not very good. Most of the sound is very flat and the bass is not nearly as good as advertised. But my biggest problem is that these earbuds are very loud, even when I have my volume almost all the way off I find that its still pretty loud which makes them unusable when I'm trying to go to sleep. They also apparently do not offer returns so make sure that you really want these before you buy them.

I have had these earbuds for little over a year now and I can confidently say that I have fallen in love with this brand. The sound quality is really good. That being said there are somethings that can be annoying or glitchy with this product. Whenever you are adjusting the earbuds in your ears it is really easy to accidentally pause whatever you are listening to or to turn up or down the volume so be warned. Sometimes when you take the earbuds out of the case one or both of them wont turn on you you have take them in and out of the case again. That being said these are the best wireless earbuds I have ever had for a really good price. I really do recommend them.

I use this these for phone calls mostly. They are very comfortable. It’s hard to know the battery level because it’s basically just a single light that blinks and you have to know how many blinks mean how full the battery is. I charge it every week just to be on the safe side and it lasts all week. And I make a 30 minute phone call on it every day. I don’t hear the caller as well as I would like. But music is good.

I've bought these headphones twice now, and have had incredible experiences with both. The large variety of earbud sizes are a life saver (I've got weirdly tiny ears haha and the larger buds always fall out) and the sound comes through clear with no static no matter the volume. They're cute and pink, stay connected even when I'm all the way across the house in the basement, cancel out all surrounding noise, charge quickly, and hold their charge for a long while to the point where I'll often find myself wondering how they're not dead yet! My absolute favourite part is that when I work out I sweat an abnormal amount lol and most headphones tend to short out despite being ""water resistant"", but these have never given me any issues whatsoever!! They've been an absolute dream! Recently, however, my earphones charging case was stolen from my car, and I was frantically trying to find a cheap replacement for the case but was unsuccessful. I took my chances with emailing the company because their storefront said they replace missing parts, although I didn't think I qualified since I had bought my pair back in 2021, almost a full year ago. I was thoroughly shocked when representative Lilian emailed me back only 3 days later and told me they'd send me a new set!! I was completely going out on a limb and I've never experienced this level of customer service from any other company, especially through only email! The level of attentiveness and accommodation from this company, especially one with such affordable well made products, makes them absolutely worthy of a 10 star rating if only there were an option! I would choose these products over any apple products any day the two services and prices can't even begin to compare. If you need earphones do NOT hesitate to get these they're the best!!!
"

I looked up reviews on this and a lot of people said they fit tiny ears and I thought they would fit but apparently not! I loved the option of all the different sizes for the earpiece but the plastic part that goes in your ear was too long for my ear canal. I was happy with the sound and everything else, but if you have really tiny ears like me, I would recommend the brand I bought that I think I'll love. (Tozo) Got them in today and love them already which is a huge green flag for me! My ear don't feel sore after wearing them and I love the way the fit. Only recommend if they'll fit your ears correctly! Love the product besides that!

They started off well enough. Only initial gripe was that the volume on calls when set to maximum was still rather low. All other situations the volume is great. They’re also pretty comfortable and have adjustable ear pieces to better fit your ear.The reason for the low star review is because within two months the right earbud no longer makes a connection when placed in the case, so it won’t disconnect, turn off or charge when placed in the case. Making it effectively useless once the charge ran out.Update: they have a 1-year warranty and the seller graciously reached out to replace the original set. I’ve adjusted my rating and will happily up it to five stars if this set lasts longer than the previous pair. Thank you!

So, I purchased these replacing a pair of bluetooth headphones connected together by a wire.  I purchased them for mostly use with phone calls.  With that said, I was initially impressed with the sale price of $20 and i wasn't expecting the quality of a $200 pair.  Like other reviewers said, I too find it difficult to remove them from the case.  Pairing was done in a snap and the quickly connect each time they are removed from the case and they fit securely in your ears.  Battery life excellent.  As for sound quality, for music, I find no issue at all, but for phone calls, which is what I use them mostly for, I find the volume during phone calls insufficient.  I initially thought it was just the caller not talking loud enough, but found this issue to be with all the calls even though my device volume is at it's max.  I also find the noise cancelling feature almost nonexistent.  I had better noise cancelling from my previous ones.  Another issue also mentioned by other users is, the controls on the ear bud is way to sensitive.  If i attempt to adjust the position of the ear bud in my ear, the music will start playing, it is very difficult to get around this issue.  Are they worth keeping? Yes, but definitely wouldn't buy them again.

This is my second pair of these earbuds. The first we’re dropped/thrown while in the case numerous times by my kids before they stopped being able to charge. These work just as well as my first pair although I did have a hard time getting them to stay paired the first few times I used them. I had to “forget” them from my phone and re-pair them. Haven’t had that issue lately though. Definitely worth the cost!

This is a great product for the price but there is a small issue which is that there is a small but notable delay with the video and the audio.  This wouldn’t be a problem if you are just listening to something, but if you are watching a video using this device, you might notice a small delay with the sound.

I don't know how you can do better these in terms of value for money.  Don't expect them to be the greatest pair of bluetooth earbuds in the world, but they're incredible for the price.Highs:- Excellent in-ear stability: I frequently find that headphones wiggle out of my left ear, so this was a top priority for me as a runner.  I just went for a 10 mile run and there was no hint of any loosening in either ear, which was pretty surprising.  My wife uses her pair for exercise involving a lot of lateral and up and down movement, and she has no problems with them falling out either.- Great sound quality for price: I'm not an audiophile, so I'm sure some people would have qualms, but I can't remember ever purchasing a pair of headphones at $50 or below and having better audio quality.  They're a heck of a lot better than many other $30-ish dollar pairs I've found- Controls for volume and stopping with just a tap of the finger: Some other headphones don't have those features at this price point.- Good enough water resistance to run in the rainLows- The volume and play/pause tapping are a bit finicky: Sometimes I accidentally skip a podcast episode when I mean to just pause.-Wish they were waterproof: But what brand DOES have full waterproofing for $30?- Battery life: I've only used them in spurts of an hour or less, but their battery life rating isn't as high as other products.  Again, for $30 though, what do you expect?  Also, I don't need to run both earbuds straight for 7 hours without ever popping back in the case to charge?  How many people truly need better battery life than that?- They don't make me an Oreo milkshake: I asked these headphones to make me one, and I got no response.  A bit disappointing.

These will do quite nicely.  My daughter is caught up in brands and the faux need to be authentic with them.  Well, that was until she lost her airpods and i was not going to buy her any new ones.  She quickly decided it was ok to have an off brand as long as they were white.  HA I say.  I've been telling her this all along... But NOOOOOOO... So, have no fear in getting these earbuds, they work like all others.  Enjoy

I'm going to skip all the extra and just cut to the chase. I got these earphones hoping for an ""ok"" set of ear buds. In my opinion they are actually really great earbuds.Sensitivity- My earbuds weren't as sensitive as others are claiming so maybe that issue has been remedied or theirs were defective as the controls act sensible when using them.The case is quite small and versatile in the pocket or bag etc. (Type C charging also = win)An issue (to me) was the design...the case cover kind of gets in the way of getting the headphones out...still easy to get them out,just not as ergonomic as you think until you remove them. I'm sure someone with smaller hands would have no issues to note...but its still not a con to me,just a very minor inconvenience.The headphones feel solid,sturdy and built well as well as the rubber ear pieces...they are snug on the earphones,the earphones sit snug and secure and very comfortable. They come with quite a few sets of rubber tips to fit any ear.NOW: The volume is pretty high when you want it which I love ....The sound quality. It is quite fantastic,plenty of low bass. I tested the frequencies myself...its very stable across the whole range 20-20k... they start dropping off at 40hz but maintain great control and sound levels all the way to 20hz...clean bass... thuddering bass. I can't explain this in detail enough bc you almost feel the lows in you bones even though you can't hear these headphones in someone else's ears at all...Now for the punchy bass...as well as the very low bass which is great...the punchy bass is where these shine...kick drums and punchy bass lines sound GREAT on these headphones. All in all...the frequency range is very flat with no ""major"" tipping points like how most headphones fall off at 60hz and under.The Noise canceling does really good,you can still hear things...but barely (with the headphones off of course). And the battery life is as advertised...plenty of time on these to jam out.As I am an avid Amazon Reviewer...if any issues arise,I will update this review the same day.Highly recommended for the price 10/10...

I like the fact that this product provides different sizes for the in-ear covers even down to extra small.  I like that this product lets me know when my ear buds need to be recharged.  When I put them back into their case the light on the bottom will start to blink.  I like that the ear buds only take 15 minutes to recharge/charge.  I absolutely LOVE that they came in more than just white/black.  I was able to order it in my favorite color (red) and that's ALWAYS a plus for any product regardless of price.  In short, I'm happy with what I chose to purchase and even got $10 off normal price when I purchased.  If you're looking for an alternative to name brand prices consider this product.  My only ""concern""/""complaint"" is that @ least one time a friend reported that she could hear someone else on the phone w/me even though I was alone.  My guess is it's because you have to use the ear buds w/blue-tooth.  Not sure but so far it's only happened once.  I couldn't hear the voice(s) she said she was hearing so it may have been on her end and not mine.  Would I purchase this product from this company again?  Yes.  Good price.  Good product.

I’ve had them for about 2 months and they’ve been great. Connected really quickly and can go a few hours. Just be careful any side you touch controls something and will pause stop turn up or down lol but I recommend for the price saved me 200/300 dollars for my IPhone

It doesn't even have a battery meter, not the easier to put back the ear buds. Sometimes you put the ear buds back in the case and it still connects to you phone. In rare occasion it will disconnect and reconnect. The only reason I bought it because it is same day delivery. If you are not in a hurry, for the price you can get ear buds that have more functions. Since they actually work so I will keep them.

These are a really solid value alternative to airpods for someone who doesn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on earbuds. I lost my apple AirPods didn’t want to go right back out and spend $179. I found the AIHOOR Wireless Earbuds (listed now for $30 plus a 10% off coupon). Are they as amazing as Apple AirPods? No. It takes a little getting used to which one is for which ear and putting them back in the case is awkward, but I’ve had these now for a long time, and very satisfied.They are very rugged. I’ve dropped them I don’t know how many times and they still work great. The battery life is phenomenal. I went on a one week vacation and forgot the charging case, I was so stressed out, but they lasted all week! The case kept recharging the earbuds every day and never ran out itself. I have no idea the upper limit on how long the case would last.Honestly, the best thing about them, is that if you loose then or they break somehow, it’s $30… just buy another pair. I feel like I’ve gotten my money’s worth many times over and am very satisfied. You should buy these even as a black up if you own Apple AirPods.I think a few tweaks in the design and Apple would have a real rival. 5/5 stars

I love these little things. My husband has name brand ones for work. I got these for audiobook listening and ended up using them for phone calls as well. They function great. When their charge gets low the reception is spotty but charging fixes that up. The features are very similar to older version AirPods with the tapping to play and multiple charges in the case. These have been a lifesaver postpartum - often I was trapped under a sleeping baby and this way I could still make/receive calls, listen to music or a book, or even scroll social media with sound (a luxury). Great for any boring tasks like cleaning too. For the money (on sale at $24) it’s a great buy and works above expectations.

While I love these, watch a YouTube video on how to operate. The instructions are very poorly written. I love that they come with interchangeable ear buds. My ears are small, so the standard size it comes with are too large and they don’t stay in well.

These are very handy to have when you need to be hands free.  I use them when I'm working in the kitchen and I want to talk on the phone for a bit.  I use them when I know I'm going to be on hold with a company, or involved in a lengthy conversation b/c I still have my hands free.  Just anything you need to be hands free for.  My music and calls come through loud and clear.  The person on the other end can hear me just fine.  I don't have to yell.  The battery holds up great.  I would definitely recommend these ear buds.

I read a lot of the reviews saying the battery lasts for a good amount of time but mine aren’t lasting for longer than 4 hours max, and I have to charge the case every day as well otherwise it dies the next day.

To the people saying that these are as good as a set of AirPods, you are crazy. That being said they are decent for the price. The sound quality is just okay, the bass is definitely lacking but they are earbuds so I didn’t expect booming bass. The build quality seems very good. The charging case is nice and fits well. The batteries seem to last a long time but I haven’t run them dead yet. Pairing is easy but the voice is a bit annoying, would have preferred just a pairing noise or chime. The side buttons are a bit annoying at first because that’s where you would naturally push on the buds in if they start to wiggle loose. I got used to it after a while but I still hit them accidentally sometimes. The real deal breaker for me is the noticeable delay. If you’re watching a video or playing a game it’s pretty obvious. If you just use them for music it wouldn’t matter but the sound being delayed from the video noticeably pretty much ruins it. For a cheap pair of music headphones they are great but I can’t recommend them for anything else.

I work in a warehouse, can have a single bud in for safety.The battery life for a single ear bud if fully charged overnight the night before maybe 5 hours if I’m lucky. However a quick switch off from the docker case and good to go. Maybe that’s not for everyone, but if you can handle it and make it through the work day, then you’re great.Also I forgot an earbud in my pocket of my leggings and washed and dried that load of laundry. Upon discovering it, I picked it up and placed it in the docker case. Lit right up and STILL WORKS like nothing ever happened.So for the price, I cannot complain, but what made me write the review was the fact I washed and dried laundry with one in the pocket and it still works. I mean don’t go out there and run over it with a car. I’m sure the durability has their limits.Won’t go wrong with these if you’re looking for cheaper replacements to the beloved earbuds you killed and are on a budget and cannot get the precious Air pods yet.

So overall for the price your getting a decent wireless headset.. is it a name brand quality? That depends on what you are looking for. For me I was looking for a good bass, ease of access and comfort. Pretty standard. Pros: battery life has been great! ( I usually charge it after use and or before use for at least 20/30 mins if I know I'll be using them for a few hours straight) the case it comes with is nice, easy to use. The bass is pretty good too! It does cancel out noise and your not left feeling like your listening to music on the radio. Cons: it tends to glitch a little. When I say glitch I mean your listening to something and it glitches out for a second. The other con is that they are NOT sweatproof. If your working out they will slip a little. Now im not sure if there is truly a brand out there that doesn't, because the earpiece has rubber on it so it would make sense that if it gets moisture in it it'll move. I have not done extreme exercise in them, so I cannot fairly say if your moving around alot or jumping if they would stay in place. I don't care for the finger tap access to pause or skip, not my favorite feature. But that's just me. Overall for the price I think its a good deal.

Ordered these October 14th last year. They worked pretty well since then but have just begun to have connectivity issues (one earbud will connect while the other earbud fails to do so or vice versa).The voice telling me whether the buds are connected, disconnected, powered on or off or pairing has gotten kind of annoying, but for $30 earbuds that attempt to do what AirPods do, this may be the best you will get. Don't expect them to last for over a year without one or two issues.

I lost my left Apple AurPod Pro and bought these while finding a replacement.  Love them after a week!  Good sound and good battery.  Today I got a replacement airpod and can compare.  AirPod Pro slightly tighter bass, slightly more musical, with a little more fatigue at loud volumes for extended periods.  For the price you can’t beat these.  Unless your a audiophile trying to use these with Tidal Ultra HiFi - you will be happy.  Even as an Audiophile you can’t complain for the price.  Battery is comparable to Apple AirPod so far.  However cheaper products have a tendency to show these deficiencies after a couple months - so we will see.  So far Woozers glad I got them.

I had the puds for less than a month, but I liked them. They're small and comfortable and can fit anywhere.With that being said, they sadly got into the washer and dryer and that wasn't a fight they could win. The case and left ear pud still worked but the right one was unresponsive. So after going to AIHOOR's website, I found that I could do a free return and get a replacement. Lilian, (the sales rep I talked to) was very helpful and responded quickly. She gave suggestions on what to do and after that didn't work I was able to send my info to get a replacement set.Honestly, from me, it's a solid 10/10 for the product and the company!

These earbuds are comfortable and stay in place well. It is a bit annoying that they turn off and on to easily when I’m just adjusting them or tucking my hair back.

The bass on these things is INCREDIBLE!! (A2 model). I’ve been on a purchasing/returning cycle trying to find a decent pair of wireless earbuds and I’ve found a few good ones, but these.. wow. Amazing and clear sound, (so much better than the AirPod Pro dupes I found on here), the BASS is crazy compared to other earbuds I’ve tried. They are super comfy and stay put in your ears, (and I have small, sensitive ear holes lol 😆). These are perfection to me. The charging case is just a little bigger than an AirPods Pro case and very good quality, not super cheap feeling like others. 1000% recommend these. If you get them, test the bass out with “A Milli” by Lil Wayne. Just trust me, you won’t be disappointed. P.S.  I’m buying a second pair right now as back up because I never want to be without these!

I wanted a cheap pair of bluetooth earbuds because I'm sick of wires. I don't really use headphones often enough to justify the high price of them and I'm not much of an audiophile at all. That being said, music still sounds really good on these. If you're looking for a high quality earbud, you're probably not even looking at these reviews anyway since you're probably out there looking at Sennheisers or something like that.Airhoor is certainly not a name brand but I'm pleasantly surprised. They were really easy to connect to your phone and don't require any additional apps to run. I tried listening to music and podcasts, they sound great.The only complaint I have about these is that they're very loud. I have to lower my phone volume almost all the way to mute to get them to a comfortable sound level. I'm not sure why they designed them so loud because they're definitely going to give you hearing loss issues if you're even at 50% volume.As a final note, it comes with 4 different size rubber ear pieces to try to fit your ear properly and with a VERY short USB-C charging cable. The charging cable is only about 7-8"". Fortunately you probably have some spare USB-C cables as they're becoming the standard for most products.Overall, if you're looking for a budget pair of earbuds, look no further. I'm not even sure if you'll find another pair of earbuds this cheap. Regardless, they're a great option for everyone. Even if you really want high quality head phones, this could make a good back up pair if you're going on vacation or something and don't want to risk losing an expensive pair of earbuds.

I use my earbuds at work; usually only the L or R at any one time because I have to hear when people talk to me.I inadvertently tucked the left I to my back pocket of my jeans and forgot where it was for close to a week.Well, laundry day arrives at which time I locate the earbud IN the washing machine after washing clothes.  I was sure it was done for.Nope. I walked into the living room to show it to my husband and a light comes on. The thing connected to my phone!

My family has many different sets of earbuds - for AirPods, Bose noise cancelling, down to a knock off set someone got on vacation in Florida.  I use my earbuds for audio books, business calls and music during walks and exercise.I am always looking for a quality sound and long battery life. I read the reviews of these during Prime Days and decided to get a pair. The first thing I noticed was they come with 4 sizes in earbuds, making for a better fit. After a short charge they were ready for a test run.The sound quality is amazing, as good as the Bose - giving real depth to your music. The battery lasts longer than my AirPods.I’m thinking about getting several pairs for stocking stuffers!

These are not top of the line, I am sure the ones from Apple are better, but for the price they are pretty good. To the touch they feel great, 5 stars on that. I haven't had any issue with battery life, but I have not continuously listen to them for more than 2-3 hours. They are not too sensitive, and sometimes I'd need to push couple of times to pause audio. Mic works fine indoors. If there is any sort of wind or background noise, then people on the other end have trouble hearing me.

I wasn't willing to spend $150+ on Airpods, even if I had the money. So i was looking for alternatives, something that was low price, but also good quality. To make sure, I ordered 3 different brands, with similar physical design and similar price point. Used them all for a couple of days, connected to my phone and mac, and this was the only one who worked 100% of the time, regardless of the device connected to, and where both left and right units worked without problems. So i returned the other two and ordered another headset exactly like this. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative than airpods and have similar performance and battery life expectations, I would recommend this brand.

I'm still figuring these out. My biggest ""issue"" is that I bought these to run with, but the lowest volume is still fairly loud.

They do occasionally lose connection or something because there are gaps in the music flow, but not a big issue for me. Other than that, pretty impressed.

I got it so I could vid call with my long distance bf, but then my dad got me JBL earbuds for the same price (on sale), which are 10000000x better. And now my AIHOOR is back in its box collecting dust. Will give it away soon.Issues with the AIHOOR:1. Connecting to Bluetooth is slow2. Once connected, connection is spotty; audio keeps cutting3. Mic picks up voice poorly; picks up more ambient noise instead4. Audio volume is low5. Touch buttons are too sensitive; moving my hair accidentally touches it6. When I smile, laugh, or eat, the earbuds fall out; bad shape design7. It looks slick and great, but the Asian-accented woman's voice saying ""Bluetooth connected"" is untrendy. JBL's electronic trills are far more classy.Stick with long standing brands like JBL. I can hear the extra $50 difference in audio quality and convenience, and it's absolutely worth it. Not only does the Bluetooth connect smoothly and instantaneously, it comes with an app for even more audio control, perfect if you're a music freak. It also has noise cancelling tech, which is awesome.Would NOT recommend AIHOOR.

The sound quality is solid. The noise cancellation isn't bad either considering how small they are. I've owned these a month and I've charged the battery maybe once.

Overall, could've been a great earphone but the battery life's just terrible that I can't give it a good rating.

I purchased it in February and used less than 10 times. About a month ago, I realized the ear buds are not lighting up when taken out of the case even though they have been plugged in for more than enough length of time. It seemed like the charging case light never goes to solid which makes me think it is not charging correctly. And probably because of that, it is not being connected with my bluetooth and useless.

Great looking red color. I was traveling ,unable to return,One bud works great, the right bud cracks and has static at the weirdest moments.I am still using these ear buds and the crackle noise is still there, but I've upgraded my rating just due to the fact, l rarely never have to charge these,  and wear daily, I'm a  cattle farmer, so I can find them easily if I lose one ( only happened once on the tractor).

The ear buds are made on an angle to place bud in the ear canal while the control bar is outside the ear. It’s very hard to use tapping as a control as it’s dependent on the number of taps and speed of tapping sequence. The left ear controls turning down volume and the right for turning up volume; which doesn’t work if you’re only using one pod obviously. Also when tapping it’s easy to dislodge the pod in your ear causing it to now fall out the ear. For the money, not bad but it’s a middle of the road pricing for a reason
"

These are pretty good. And good for the price. The battery lasts pretty long (I haven’t timed it but I’ve probably already listened about 6 hours since my last charge). They actually do block a lot of noise - I forget it until I take them out on a busy street and am surprised at how loud the world around me is.My only complaints are, they get uncomfortable after a while, like the plastic housing is just too big for my ear. And the touch controls on the side are very sensitive - many times I’ve held my arm over my head to stretch or something and a light tap of my arm on the headphones blasts the sound up. Wish they were tactile buttons.Otherwise, they do the job and do it well.

The battery life goes on forever, not like my AirPods that last about three hours.Now, on to the negative.  I wish the sound was as loud as it is when listening to music.  During calls, I can barely hear anything. I bought them for phone calls, more than anything.  I wonder why they aren’t loud, since music is so LOUD!
"

For $30 they work better than expected. Maybe not as good audio as my Apple wireless earbuds but for using them at work they are perfect. No I don’t use them all the time, maybe just a few times a week, but they serve the purpose. Also they are kind of uncomfortable after keeping them in your ear for a while. If you don’t want to spend a lot of money on a set of these and you’re not going to use them a lot.. these are perfect. Just wish I could figure out what I did with them because now I can’t find them.
"

I ordered these for work. I usually only wear one at a time so I can still hear what’s going on around me. The battery is amazing! I don’t have to charge them very often. I had to get used to the touch to mute on the ear pieces but I k ew about that from reviews I read so it was easy to figure out. I do wish they was one more level of softer music before it went to 0 but overall that’s really not that much of a problem. I’m so glad I bought these instead of spending $100+ for other ones. These work AMAZING!!! I’ve told all my friends to buy them!

if you like deep bass, these are for you.  I barely hear any midrange or treble. the drums drown out the rest. can hear the voice well, but drums take it over. il probably be returning these.

Got these on Amazone Prime day, charged them once, and I STILL have close to a full battery, and I use them for a couple hours everyday. Great product for a great price.

They are easy to setup and I would definitely recommend them to a friend!

The one complaint I have is there are no written instructions...just drawings and arrows. I am 75 yrs old and am trying to stay abreast of all these innovations, but this one stumped me. I finally figured out how to pair it since I have an Apple watch that I paired, but no written word help from manufacturer.  Still no idea how to turn it on or off.  But for the average age consumer of these things I think they would be great earbuds....easy peasy!  The sound is fabulous and the bass is to die for if if that's a plus for you. Only had them for about an hour but I'd say a very good product for the price point.

I like these! They have great quality, and fit right into my ear; Unlike other earbuds. I genuinely like them I can hear great through them! I also ordered a case, while I was looking at reviews before buying I saw someone saying that it (the earbuds) fit their old AirPod pro case. So curiously I bought a AirPod pro case, hopefully it fits the ones I got because I just bought it😭😭 but if not I’ll just return them (the case). But overall they are cool! I had earbuds that had a touch feature with it, so I’m kinda already used to the touching feature😁

Great sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.  Connects easily and touch controls are very responsive.  I bought these three times, and had a somewhat different experience each time though.  With all three, the right earbud's touch control would kind of ""stick,"" resulting in a permanent volume-up input, and after a few seconds the earbud would just power off. This happened about a month after I got each one.  One of the charging cases broke, so now I have to use two earbuds in the same case, and the third pair stopped working altogether so I had to throw it away.  Overall they're nice, but still cheaply made, hence the cost.

These ear buds are easy to charge, pair and use. They are slightly uncomfortable and the tone/pitch is higher than I expected. I don’t even notice that they have noise cancellation.  I will keep them because I don’t use them very often. If I used them often I would send them back.

Item arrived on time and in good condition and works as expected.  The only negative is that when it was delivered, it was left inside my screened-in porch, no bell was rung, all of which is okay, but , deliveryperson marked it as delivered directly to a resident which is not true.

The mic doesn’t provide clear sound and they don’t hold a charge very long. I had a zoom meeting and people said I sounded muffled and they died within an hour. I charged them for 3 days and when I connected to my laptop it said they were only charged to 80%. I made sure the charger was firmly inserted and after 2 days the same thing, only to 80% and died after an hour of use. Don’t waste your money. There are much better earbuds for the same cost.

I have had a number of these lower cost earbuds.  I use them for mostly for my laptop where sound quality is not important.  I found these uncomfortable in my ear and just not very good quality compared to the 3 other $20-50 range earbuds.  My main earbuds are Jabra Elites and they are exceptional in every way and the cost is 3-5x because you are paying for quality.  I bought these because the Jabras can't connect to Windows laptops which is a frustrating bug that Jabra actually admits to in their help but doesn't fix.  I would suggest trying another low price earbud to these such as TOZO which I had a few years ago and had really good experience with for the price.

Bought these on a whim. Most of the reviews were positive and even more recommended them for small ears.

Can’t speak much on battery life since I haven’t used them much, but the sound quality isn’t terrible. It’s pretty good for earbuds and definitely surprised me, although they don’t sound as amazing as my HyperX Cloud Alphas.Bluetooth connection so far has been fine, they sound great :)My pc has bad Bluetooth so anything that gets too far away from it (like 5 feet) gets glitchy/disconnects, and I definitely had that with these too.They have decent noise cancelling, although I feel most earbuds do since you stick them directly in your ears. I think they’re more noise cancelling than my HyperX.That’s all, they are pretty good earbuds. The packaging is nice, only thing of note is they smelled like chemicals. Like bleach kinda, or like they had jsut painted them? Idk. I washed the earbuds (not the actual physical ones, the cover things) and it still smelled a bit strange but I’m assuming that’ll go away over time.In all they’re pretty decent earbuds! I was surprised for the 30$ I got them for.

Decent volume. Not as much Bass as I was expecting based on the description. Good battery life. I easily got 6 hours of podcast and the battery still showed around 50% according to my phone.

I was skeptical of thesr at first and I decided to get them for work and gym. And I've been using them non stop for the last 4 months. A full charge lasts me two days and I have them on for about 10 hours a day. There have been times where the sound goes in and out but im thinking it's the Bluetooth connection. They're sweat proof. Noise canceling. I usually only do a level 1 sound so one click on my volume and its good enough to cancel noise. These are great. I will probably buy more colors

These are inexpensive and for the price they are the best, the most reliable I've found. I've had them for 3 months and used them literally every day. There have been a few weird glitches that got fixed when reset. Battery life is great. Noise cancelling isn't amazing but its good. You can use each ear peace independently which is HUGE because even $300+ brands don't do that. The fact that they've lasted 3 months and are still going already makes them better than jabra from a $$ point of view. I'm done with jabra and their headsets that break after 3-6 months for $200-$300 I'll just buy these.

This ear buds work just as well as my brand names ones that I lost.  The sound quality is great.  No need to pay more except the battery life is about 1.5 hours.  They last through my workouts but if need longer battery life might want to get two since so inexpensive.

Right out of the box they paired easily and had a full charge. I'd read the reviews so I was expecting to like them just fine. I was not prepared for the great sound quality however.

I lost one of my apple AirPod pros and bought these as a inexpensive replacement that wouldn’t break the bank if lost. I am pleasantly surprised at the sound quality, ease of use and battery life. My single complaint is if you take them out of your ears there isn’t a sensor to stop the app. Again, this might not be an issue if I hadn’t already experienced how intuitive the apple version are. But apple comes with a steep price that I’m not able to replace. These are serving me well and I have purchased a couple sets to keep in different locations.

So I have AirPods but of course, lost one and cannot find it. I’m going on a trip soon so having a full set is a must on an international flight (hold up Karen, fully vaxed and boosted before you come for me). These are SO GOOD!!! Set up was easy, instantly paired, and WAY more comfortable than the AirPods. They even come with different size cushion thingys (I’m sure there’s a better technical term) for your ear. Great sound and they stay put. And I was also quite impressed with the packaging! Just as fancy as Apple’s for a fraction of the price. They don’t last quite as long as Apple, but you can just charge them so it’s not a huge deal. Seriously, skip the pods and get these.

These are grest for the money. However i have long hair and sometimes my hair touching the touch ckntrols pauses or skips and even adjusts the volume.

When I first got these headphones, I was a little confused by the touch-sensitive sides.  I kept accidentally hitting them and pausing/unpausing my audiobooks.  I even left a 2-star review over what I thought was a malfunction.After a few days of use, however, I got used to the buttons, and they're pretty intuitive once you know they're there.  I appreciate that I can both rewind and fast forward Audible by double-tapping the left or right side, and control the volume by holding them.  The buttons are still a little oversensitive, and you have to be careful not to touch them while taking the earbuds out and/or putting them away.

Pleasantly suprise with these for the price I spent. Got them on a lightening deal and haven't been disappointed.  The sound is clear and loud. My 13 year old son said I should've just got air pods but I'm fine with these for what I need them for.  They stay in my ear 99% of the time....they fell out a couple times while I was moving around a lot with a beanie on, but it was only a couple times. I think the hardest part is figuring out where and how to tap to control the volume, turn on/off, etc

These are my first set of wireless ear pods. I was a little confused when first setting them up but once I figured that out they seem to work great. So far I have no complaints.

I've never liked ear buds and they tend to hurt and annoy me when I wear them for more than an hour or so.  These are very comfortable, and I can (and have) actually forget I have them in.  Sound quality is significantly better than I was expecting.  The product advertises a 15 hour battery life.. I think maybe they added 7.5 hours per ear bud together, because that seems to be about the charge life on them.  Still very happy with the product and going to purchase another pair for my partner when she gets her new phone.

Since I already have a pair of Apple Airpods Pros(gift), which only come in white, I decided to give these a try. The only thing that really concerned me when I purchased them was if they would hold up to my intense workouts.

I work on my feet half the day and drive the other half. These earbuds live up to the description and last all day.

The battery life is great on these and if I’m sitting somewhere not moving they work great but what’s the point of having wireless if you don’t move. I take these when I go out for a walk and any wind will make one stop working and when I get a phone call I’ve had my call hang up several times when using these when it has never happened when I don’t use them, sometimes the call comes through on them, sometimes I can’t hear anything and have to use my phone and half the time after a call I can’t get them connected to my music again.  If I don’t get any calls and there’s no wind they work fine but I guess you get what you pay for.

I wear these for work at my desk. They're comfortable most of the time and work as expected 80% of the time. Sometimes the audio just stops working. Like full volume, full battery, both ear buds in and I still can't understand what's happening on my phone. I'd exchange them but I'm outside of the exchange window by a couple of weeks. Disappointed.

Tap was annoying, kept hanging up on people if you touch it. Volume is low
"

When I first put these in my ears after charging them they did have a very good sound. They’re super touchy though so if you’re moving them around in your ears and you hit them they can go out of sync now I cannot get them back into sync no matter what I do have followed the instructions have looked up a YouTube video and they just will not pair up again to each other. Only one gets sound or the other gets sound But not at the same time. I was going to return them but I’m waiting for the battery to die so that I can see if when I charge them again I can get them both working together and try to keep my fingers away from the areas that change things. I don’t know why these have to be so complicated!  They are just ear phones!

The sound is good, nice recharging case and they are handy. Con, battery life is a bit short, about 3 hours max either listening to music or in Zoom / Teams calls. If you need longer than 2.5 -3 hours at a time of continued use, then you will need a different pair of BT headphones.

The sound is fine, the battery life is ok, and they look similar to ipods, but they are so sensitive to touch and movement that they turn off, pause, or the volume increases/lowers at the slightest movement. Don’t brush your hair aside - you’ll turn them off. Don’t scratch your ear, or move your head too fast either! Constant interruptions to play at normal, light movements seems like a design flaw. Affordable, yes, but I only use them if the battery runs out on my other ones now. Too annoying to use.

"
2279,"
The sound is great but that's about it. I couldn't find a size of the rubber ear buds that fit comfortably in my ears and weirdly the two ear buds fit differently. The left is wonky and the right is fine. The instructions regarding volume, muting, pausing seemed easy enough but it hasn't been the case. It's rare I am able to pause my music and all it seems to do is raise the volume. Not as pleased as I thought I would be. It shouldn't be this complicated.
"
2280,"
I was really excited for these and really wish that I could have left a positive review, because I loved the way they looked and the packaging was nice and sleek... First problem, I have small ears which these advertise for. Unfortunately they did not work for me, while in my ears they felt fine, nice and secure like they wouldn't come out. But after taking them out my ears felt very sore, and this is after putting in the XS ear piece, and would eventually slip out of my ear after some time. Second problem, if I wanted to connect to a specific device like my laptop I had to ensure that my bluetooth was turned off on any other device that these things are paired with. If I didn't it would randomly connect to different devices. Third and final issue was the battery life. I work in an office and tried to use these for meetings on Teams, one ear bud would die within 5 minutes of the meeting, after being charged all night and not used until the meeting, and the other would die part way through the meeting... Save yourself the headache and look at different earbuds.

These are the best off brand AirPods. I charged them when I first opened the package and have not had to plug them in again for 3 weeks now. The pink is so cuts!

I’ve had these headphones for 3 months now and I regret buying them. I got them because of a lightning deal but they are more trouble than what they’re worth. They connect well but after 10 minutes on a call, all I get is static and too much feedback. If I use these close to my computer, the static gets worse. The other person can’t hear me and I hear them with a static break every other word.I’ve reset the connection multiple times and I’m still having issues.

They’re good headphones and have surprising range.  Take time to find the ear piece that’s the right fit for you.  They’re touchy, so be patient, they’re going to skip, pause or turn off when you adjust them with your hand.  Great product for the price overall though. Would recommend. 👌

For the price can't be beat I use these in place of my apple earbuds pro at work out of fear of potential loss and find the quality, sound and functionality on par. Only drawback between the two is the fit in the case, the buds are more difficult to remove and place back in the case, for the price worth the hassle.

Sound is great no complaints there….they are not very comfortable even with diff sized ear silicon pieces.

They may not have some of the fancy features that airpods have but they stay in my ear very well for that style and have the best battery life, volume, and sound quality combo at this price point and I have tried many Bluetooth headphones ranging up over the $100 mark.

Easily comparable to the Apple Air pods in quality.

I purchased these headphones because I couldn’t originally afford airpods. These headphones are not only comfortable, but have excellent sound quality and works wonderfully with running.

They worked great for about 3 months. Sound quality was perfect, they were easy to connect and disconnect to my phone, they were great. Then things started going downhill the beginning of June. At first it was just an occasion cutting in and out of music; not ideal but not a huge problem. Then they started connecting and disconnecting at random from my phone. Again, not a big deal, but a bit annoying. Then this morning I plugged them in to charge, and less than 2 hours later heard a pop and smelled melted plastic to find they had exploded and melted to my counter. The charger is melted inside the case and the case is melted shut, but luckily it didn’t start a fire in my outlet. Maybe I got a defective pair, but I just wanted others to know in case it happened to anyone else.

Every time I get a call, it is difficult to turn them on and I hang up on the caller.  To hear on my iPhone I then have to go to settings to undo pairing, or I still cannot talk to my caller.  By the time I get it set up the caller has moved on and are not available.  What a waste of my money.  The only positive I found was the liners come in a bunch of sizes.
"

Affordable, comfortable, batteries last a long time and are easily re-chargeable, bluetooth pairing is a snap and they have good sound quality. But when used with a hearing app the latency (sound delay) makes them almost useless. This is a common problem, apparently, with bluetooth ear phones.ok for listening to music or pod casts. Haven’t tried it with telephone calls yet.

After using for a few months, I’m searching for new headphones. What I like: great sound, easy to set up. Don’t  like: Too big. Painful after an hour of use. Touch controls are too sensitive. If I adjust the fit, the song will pause or change volume.

I didn't mind the plastic feeling of the case or headphones. I didn't care for the accent of the headphone's narrator telling you that it's on, off, searching or disconnected. But what I did mind was that only 1 headphone works great at any given time.I needed headphones for my surface laptop. It already has a Bluetooth connection with its pen and keyboard. When I use 1 headphone, it works!But as soon as I put on both headphones at once, the sound quality gets choppy! I assume this is because it has a weak Bluetooth connection that gets scrambled once you put on both headphones. So, if your device has many connections to it, don't be surprised if it scrambles the audio of this cheap headphone.

Overall, good value for money. The only negative is that the volume for device prompts (""pairing"", ""connecting"", etc.) is way too loud -- I have to remember to hold the earbuds an inch or two away from my ears so that they don't blast my eardrums every time I switch between devices.Update 1: It's been just over six months and these earbuds do not power down and/or recharge properly when put back in the charging case.Update 2: Manufacturer was very prompt in sending a replacement set  -- faulty set was still under warranty. Hopefully, the replacement will last longer. Upgrading to 3 stars for excellent service.
"

These buds are a nice sound quality. Good bass tones and clear highs. The sensors for pause and skip could be a little more sensitive. My biggest dislike is the charging case has no indication telling you what percentage your cases battery life is or any indication that your buds are actively charging. I have a set of veatol buds that don’t sound as nice but the case and charging system is better.

The Bluetooth connection is great and sound quality is relatively good, my only suggestions are that it could use better noise cancellation, and play louder. I would also like to mention battery life. The battery life of the individual ear buds are poor. I do not understand why one or both earbuds will cut out or ""power off"" shortly after a overnight charge (assuming 7/8 hours is plenty for full charge). With this being said, when comparing products with both quality and cost I wouldn't expect a nearly $30 product to match a $130 pair of air pods. Although I would like to have better reason to choose it over wired earbuds.
"

It was great for about 3 months using about 30 minutes per day. One earbud stopped charging, I wrote the company, and they sent me a brand new unit. So I am incredibly surprised at how awesome their customer support is. I think that my issue was an anomaly. It’s a good device.

I like that I can use them and have my iPhone on the charger.  They connect immediately after removing them from the nice case.  I used them on a plane 2 1/2 hours each way and they still were over 2/3 charged.I recommend these for ease of use and decent sound.
"
2376,"
The control on the earbud itself isn’t an actual button; Its touch controlled, so just adjusting the headphone back into your ear turns the sound off or even powers down. Then you have to put back in the case and pull back out to power on effectively which isn’t very user friendly when you’re breastfeeding your newborn to sleep and listening to podcasts. Sound quality is average, battery life is average, wouldn’t order again.
"

I really like these because of their small size and how comfortable they are in your ear.

Earbuds seem to have good battery life.  They were easy to sync to my Samsung phone. Sound quality is better then expected, for the price.  They also stay in my ears pretty well.  I had purchased another wireless set a while back and had trouble with them falling out.  These are nice and snug, without being too tight.

Needed basic earphones/mic to connect to my Windows laptop for zoom calls. Does the job, was easy to pair and getting started. Have been using it only for a day now and battery held up well for my usage.  The touch buttons are very sensitive. the look and feel is very cheap but so is the price. I like the volume controls in the earbuds. Overall satisfied for the amount I paid.

I ended up losing my expensive wireless headphones at the beach. I couldn’t take corded ones at the gym. So, I ordered these based on review and I’m in love with them.

The sound quality is poor. There is little to no noise cancellation. I have difficulty hearing callers in phone conversations due to low volume. They continuously hang up my phone calls. I wish I was still able to return them.***Update***The seller swiftly addressed my concerns and even upgraded my earbuds to better quality one that better suite my needs. They were very polite and made me feel heard and appreciated as a customer. Excellent Customer Service!!Also, I would recommend the A4 model for anyone that is looking for good quality earbuds.

It was good according to the price. But the sound quality doesn't match with the video. Means when you watch a video with those airpod, the characters say a word and you will hear the sound in your airpod after a moment. It is good for listening music rather than watching movie. Otherwise overall it's good.

Bought this as a gift for my mom. She doesn’t understand tech that well but she was able to use these on her own. I have tried 2 other options for wireless headphones and these are the ones she wants to keep. The touch can be a little sensitive but I’m glad that it’s touch and not a button like other models. Touch allows for easier choosing for my mom. She doesn’t have to press hard at all to get where she needs to go.

Worth it for the price. Good quality, I work in outdoor conditions below 20• usually they still work fine, every couple hours I change out the side because the battery needs to charge recommend only using 1 side at a time if you’re using them for more then 2 or 3 hours at a time non stop. I’d buy them again without hesitation.

Very nice headphones for the budget price...Great sound, easy pairing, comfortable to wear and great battery life. Unfortunately, the controls are terrible. No matter how you try to single tap, double tap etc they never do what you want. Anytime I try to advance to the next song, the tap either pauses (supposed to be a single tap) or tries to open Google assistant doesnt skip to the next song. Then when I do try to pause with a single tap, it advances to the next song. Unfortunately, this is really a pain as the whole point of headphones like this is to be able to control your phone with a few simple taps vs having to take your phone out of your pocket or wherever it may be. Too bad they couldnt make this work the way it should, which I have found seems to be a common issue with these budget wireless ""pods""UPDATE. Seller reached out to me offering a replacement. Provided my address per their request but replacement never arrived.

These sound as good or better then my $150 wired dual driver ear buds. Wish I'd found these first. New issue is after three weeks of vacation, these no longer work correctly, the left earbud is dead, will not factory reset like the youtube videos show. Lights up when returned to the case but won't recover after charging overnight, won't recover after repeated reset attempts. The left earbud is just dead, to bad I really liked the sound and fit.
"
2437,"
I got these for work and if so listened to only one earbud at a time, it would last my six hour shift which seems pretty normal. However, if I ever used them on a walk, they would go in and out and almost ‘skip’, whereas my husband’s earbuds (not this brand) would not do this when I used them. Additionally they just randomly stopped playing sound in them last week. Fully charged, fully connected, they even play the ‘connected’ sound and show connected to my phone, they just do not play sound any longer. Really unfortunate, would definitely not purchase again.

These earbuds are pretty good for a cheap price. They have great sound quality but not great with noise cancellation.

I’m always nervous to buy technology products that I’ve never heard of, but this one was not a regret! Especially for this price. The sound quality is great- way better than I imagined. I read some previous comments about how some people hate how the headphones are touchy, but I don’t mind it- I think it’s extremely convenient you control volume, change tracks, etc. They do fit a little big in my ear, but I typically don’t leave them in for an extended period of time for it to bother me.

I haven't used a lot, and not using for music. Can't figure out how to increase the volume, as trying to use them with my phone to talk to family member on the way home.

I wanted to like these, but I have super small ears, apparently, and even on the smallest rubber nub thing the buds will not nestle in my ears. There is no quality sound, nothing close to noise cancelling sound and I’m constantly having to adjust, push the bud or buds back into my ears multiple times when wearing them. Bought them to use while working out (low impact) and I regret having spent the money. I’m beyond the return window or I would return these and attempt to find a product to fit my needs and my ears.

Hasta ahora no he tenido problemas con la carga de la batería. El sonido está bastante bien, emparejan fácil con cualquier dispositivo.

Hay que fijarse en cerrar el bluetooth del dispositivo para desconectar correctamente los audífonos cuando se regresan al estuche.

UPDATE: While I loved these earbuds, the left one started to go out. I tried everything in the FAQs and manual, and finally I emailed their customer service...twice. Haven't received a response. I'm extremely disappointed that they couldn't even email me back.I must have weird ear holes because no ear buds are comfortable- except these. I jog with these and they stay put and don't bother me at all. My only complaint is that if I readjust them for any reason, I bump the pause button. Honestly though, these are fantastic. They also charge quickly and hold a charge.

Main reason I returned these - Product page describes that as ""designed for small ears"" but they are extremely painful for my smaller ears.Secondary reason I returned - Would not stay in my ears while sitting in my office chair.  I would not trust them to stay in on a bike ride, bus ride, or even a walk.  They also no not come with any other ear cushions of different sizes and the material used is very flimsy compared to other in ear headphones I have used.Last reason I returned - tap controls as horrible.  Volume is not one of the controls available.  Volume can only be controlled from the phone/playback device.  Of the remaining controls, there is noticeable lag from when tapped before the action takes place.  This makes it difficult to know if it worked or if another tap is needed and can cause play/pause turn into next/previous track, or next/previous track to turn into voice assistant.  Or the worst, answer call turns into dismiss call.

I am aware that these are not noise-canceling earbuds. However, I was not prepared to be able to hear absolutely everything when I am listening to music at a decent volume while wearing these.

My husband and I have been walking outdoors for several months. Sometimes it gets a little boring and hard to push through with the heat so I ordered these so I could listen to music to better pass the time. My son recommended these. The sound is great. The battery is more than long enough and they come with several sizes of soft ear piece covers for comfort and good fit.

Followed instructions on the listing,  but only one ear played on iphone.  Had other problems on Android.  Would cut in and out,  which I couldn't fix.

I wanted to get new earbuds since my AirPods were starting to wear out. I came across these Aihoor earbuds and was skeptical, even after reading reviews. I will say that after using them for a few days now, I am really impressed with how these sound. The bass is amazing and they are very sleek in a matte black case. They also connect rather easily once connected to bluetooth!
"
2573,"
Mainly, they don't fit so I constantly have to push them back into the right position. This is causes them to turn off. Then randomly i'll pull them both out of the case and one will just turn it self off completely. So i have to put it back in and take it out to turn the earbud back on. People can't hear me that well either and that's bad because I'm LOUD. Other than that the sound quality is pretty good. And people can't hear what you're doing.
"

The darn things don’t hold the charge as advertised, but still a decent set of buds. When I put them up I have to drop them in a couple of times to make sure they are connected properly for the charging to work.

Touch sensitive these are.Which makes them weird for me atleast.it was so inconvenient to take the out of the box... not a good design if you ask me.They do look nice.I couldnt get the voice control to work somehow.I had to return them anyways.Didnt like them really.Sound was OK though.

Sometimes when it pairs it only recognizes one of the headphones, sound only comes out of one of them. So I have to put them back in the case and take them out again and re-pair them, and usually that will fix it. The sound quality is not fantastic but it’s expected for this price. I haven’t had any issue with the controls on them.

Poor sound quality and only worked ""right"" for a week, then the sound started cutting out like every 5 seconds which is agitating. I didn't notice any type of noise cancelation. Then the left stopped charging right and when I would use both together the left would force the volume of both all the way down, then power off the left one only. Aside from that they are hard to get in and out of the case because the squared shape of the stems and they are too short to grip easily. I bought them because the reviews were mostly good but that wasn't my experience with them. They are going back right now.

After less than a month of use (at tops, 3 hours per day) the ear pieces stop connecting all the way. Only one ear piece would connect at a time. I tried everything to get them to connect together again with no luck.Thankfully I didn't spend a lot of money on these because they are cheaply made.

I gave these three stars based off the color which matches my iPhone. Other than that I wasn't impressed. The headphone controls are too sensitive and at times I found myself skipping songs when I wanted to pause or turning up the volume when I simply wanted to adjust the placement of the earbud. Also there are too many control and light options to remember to signify battery life, Bluetooth connect etc. Keep it simple. I returned these.

I read & researched & the product description was impressive.  HOWEVER, I attempted to use these buds, only 3x. I use buds to focus on my workout. The Right bud first did not work at all, so, I charged it more. Then, it worked and kept shutting off. After wearing these buds for less than 15 minutes, a strange, annoying sounds come from both buds, that I am 'fear' of doing some SERIOUS audio/ear damage, from the buds!!!! SCARY.  I WILL BE RETURNING THIS ITEM, SADLY THEY DON'T WORK.-L
"

I like these because it is great sound quality  that I can listen my music while working! Very convenient!
"
2610,"
Simply put, the buds won't pair after just a few months from purchase and with minimal use. Item was used less than an hour a week for a few month, maybe 20 hours total and then they simply stopped pairing. I can get sound out of only one bud, sometimes the left, usually the right, but never both. I spent 2 hours trying to fix the issue before concluding that they were fubar.That's only the half of it. From day one, they would lose connection briefly in either the right or left bud depending on which pocket I had my phone. Phone on the left, the right bud would skip, phone on the right, the left bud would skip. The skipping occurred about once every song or two and lasted less than a second. I had to hold my phone out in front of me to avoid skipping. Note that my phone connects to my car, my friend's car and my home PC Bluetooth without issue.Finally, I can connect other buds to my phone without problem and encountered the same lack of pairing when trying to connect the Aihoor with a friend's phone. Result: These buds are worth about $1 max, anything more is a rip-off. A pair of tin cans connected via string produces more reliable sound.
"

Sounds is good. Easy to operate. BUT, the sound does not completely match the picture. The sound is a fraction behind the lips, when watching someone talking/singing.

I bought these so that I could use them with my motorcycle, but they did not work well with a helmet. They would shut off during my trips, which meant I needed to stop alongside the road to figure out what was going on. After just a few weeks, the left earbud stopped working all together.
"

El producto suena muy bien, la batería está, bien, muy sensible al tocarlos, pero es cuestión de familiarizarnos con los toques , muy bien gracias
"
2622,"
It's an okay product. The sound quality is good, but having finger-print buttons is inconvenient. When I adjust the headphone in my ear I always accidentally push them and pause what I'm listening to. Also, I can only use one at a time for work. So having a layout where each headphone button has different functions is not useful to me and hard to navigate. Again, not a terrible product, but these are things to consider.
"

I’ve only had them for a couple of months and the right earbud no longer works! Up until now they’ve  worked fine. Of course it’s beyond the return policy days so I’ll be looking for a different brand next time.

Was hoping for a better outcome. No one can hear me talk when I use them. Which is a need for me, whole point of earbuds. Can still hear my neighbors fighting, noise canceling isn't a thing. Only thing that is nice about these. Battery does hold a charge

I've never had wireless buds before but took a chance.  Once you get used to the # of taps to make it work it has been fabulous.  Working, walking, or just relaxing, it's nice to move around and not have to open my phone every time to listen to music or talk on the phone.

I mostly use these earbuds when I watch videos on my phone and answering phone calls. Works great so far. The battery lasts about 5 hours, which is a big plus. Only downside is a poor bass sound when I listen to music. But other than that, these earbuds are worth for the money.

I actually like the product and works well in a quiet environment. Unfortunately I live and work on a busy traffic street and my clients cannot hear me.Sound is good for listening to music.Beware!

The earbuds are ok at best, if you use one at a time you can get a total of 8 hrs 4 hours each nothing beyond that, so that’s misleading they are very sensitive so be careful with touching them, I will not recommend because I don’t feel they are worth the money

When I can use them, I like them. I have used them once with my phone for music while I'm doing whatever and twice I have gotten them to work for the reason I purchased them. I bought them to use with my Switch because the volume doesn't work in handheld mode. Here is where my major issue comes in. For every 10 times I try to connect to the device, it will connect once if I'm lucky. I will get it ready, hit connect on the Switch and as its searching, the ear bud will say connected. WTH is it connected to!!?? Certainly not my device. Complete waste of money. Now I have to buy a different set in hopes that I won't have the same issue. While yes they are nicely inexpensive, I could have gotten farther putting that money in my gas tank then it has benefited me to use these.

These earbuds were a great purchase… in the beginning… around 3 months later, one ear bud started going in and out on sound. It would connect but there was no sound.

I tried several times, but had little to no success.  The devices work as a pair, but when I got them connected to bluetooth, there were two separate connections. As a result, one side would work or the other, but never as a pair, so no stereo.  Tried several times to reset but got the same result when trying to pair them.  Very frustrating.  I tried their tech support chat, but I'm not going to install their software to do a chat.  Documentation is a joke - you need a magnifier.  I'm returning them.

I bought these after reading the piles of positive reviews. I wish I had just glanced at the 1 star reviews, maybe I would have hesitated to purchase them.While charging, these earbuds ignited and caused a lot of damage. They were smoking and sparking when we found them and had already melted the screen of a nearby phone and tablet. We are INCREDIBLY lucky they did not start a major house fire. If we had found them 10 or 20 minutes later, our kitchen would have been in flames. Our house still reeks of melted plastic. It's a nightmare. Electronics should have basic fail-safes to prevent overheating and fire. These do not. Spend a little more money or go with a different company. Do not risk fire with these crappy little earbuds. Not worth it.

I don’t usually write reviews but I am for this product. The headphone were great but only lasted a couple months. The wiring when you put the headphone into the charge sucks. It bent I guess and now only the r side will charge and it’s annoying to listen with only one side working. There’s no way to reach into the charging area to fix it so now I’m out of luck. Buying a different brand next time.

It would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact it sometimes randomly disconnects. And I have to go through a long series of steps just to get it to reconnect. Not to mention NOT GOOD FOR PHONE CALLS. I'm always getting complaints that the sound quality of the mic is bad or that it's muffled.UPDATE: 8 months later the left ear bud stopped working. I've had cheaper wireless earbuds that lasted for 3 years and this didn't even make it to a year.

Won’t disconnect from my phone when placed in case unless I press them in hard. They will still reconnect randomly minutes later. I’m also having trouble getting the right side to charge now.

I read the previous reviews and thought I’d give these earbuds a shot for a backup pair.  The price was awesome on a lightening deal. Packaging was really nice and I had high hopes that they buds were going to be good.Well- to be honest, these buds are awful. With the sound all the way up the sound was thin and with no extra bass to help round out the song.I can’t say anything on the noise cancellation features or the battery life.  The buds were returned the same day they arrived.

The single, double and triple tap controls work about 10% of the time, if even. There is no way to adjust the amount of bass in the headphones either. For some, that bass is nice, but all the time? Nah. Phone calls are also not as loud as music, which is a major let down. I don't know why this is, but some calls are loud and some are not - despite raising the volume up. Even for $30 these just aren't worth it. The magnetic case and clip INS are a nice touch, but I need the headphones to work.

These headphones are pretty nice for the price however they aren’t really supportive and effective. I’m using the smallest ear bud sponge and they still feel chunky in my ears & the sound only feels elevated when they’re shoved deep inside your ear. The final straw for me is that felt that it constantly hangs up my phone calls if I touch them by accident and won’t always work for calls.  I had higher hopes of these based on other reviews but…. Kind of disappointed.

Do not buy these headphones. They are terrible.Especially if you are a user of IOS avoid these headphones at all cost. You can’t connect both headphones at the same time. To turn off or turn on you have to use some fingerprint sensor because they didn’t add a button which is terrible. IOS won’t let you pair two devices simultaneously so even if they say both devices are connected you can’t play them at the same time. It is even more terrible that you have to connect them individually and they can’t just both be using the same Bluetooth connection. The sound is decent I’ll give it that but the rest of it is poorly designed and this product you be taken off of Amazon permanently so you people don’t have to suffer like I did. These earbuds are pieces of garbage. I rest my case.

The battery life for these ear buds is astonishingly short.  The right ear is flaky with audio going in and out. They sometimes just spontaneously turn off at the end of a podcast. The case lid doesn't open all the way so getting the ear buds in and out of the case is a pain.

The sound was decent for the price with a nice battery life. That is where the pros end. The touch controls while easy to use are very touchy. The case doesn’t open very far so you have to pinch and be careful to not snap off the lid. The main drawback is the shape of the earbuds, they have this shape that presses uncomfortably into your ear when you try to put them in.
"
2868,"
Ever wonder what the difference between expensive and cheap wireless earbuds is? This product, that’s what! I have bad tinnitus in both ears and bought these so I could listen to music while I fall asleep. As I turns out you have to spend at least 15-20 minutes trying to get the earbuds to connect via Bluetooth and then even if they do connect, they disconnect after a few minutes. So unless you’re looking to become and stay frustrated every time you want to use earbuds, skip these. This product proves that spending the extra money for a quality product is worth it to ensure devices connect as they should. Next time I’ll just give the $30 to the neighbor kids to waste on slurpees and hot dogs at the gas station since at least some joy will come out of it.

I've never left a bad review from any of my purchases on Amazon, even when my keyboard came without a flash drive. Just be careful when you buy these ear pods.After feeling so excited and raving about these ear pod, I realized that the battery case is totally faulty. I found this out after the 2nd purchase. The 1st purchase lasted about a month and a half. I figured that it was a faulty ear pod (right). I made the 2nd purchase, and the left ear pod went out. I tried the left ear pod from the 1st purchase, which it worked, and it didn't work in the battery case of the 2nd purchase. They seem to have a life span of 45 days. What a hassle.

I don’t know what headphones these people got in the other reviews but these headphones are not it. I’ll start this by saying I have an iPhone so I cannot speak for how it works on android. First off, pairing this was hard asf. It took me multiple tries. The headphones kept saying “turning off” and this is with it being fresh out the box. When I finally got it paired, it kept disconnecting. The sound quality is not good, it sounds muffled. If you want to be heard clearly when speaking, talk loud and clear. Definitely not worth to me and I just got them and only have had them for less than 30 minutes. Seems like AirPods would be better and worth its expense. Sometimes cheaper isn’t better.

Item worked fine for a couple weeks. Then, the right ear bud would no longer hold charge. After trying Aihoor’s tutorial to fix them several times to no avail, I contacted them via email. No response, and after looking at some reviews it seems to be a familiar experience for a lot of users. Shop your business elsewhere

I got these blasted things for a week and their already acting buggy, and when I say buggy I mean it stops making sound completely at random even when its on full battery (which is really annoying), and it's stadicing out sometimes when im listening to music. TOTAL WAIST OF MONEY!

I bought a pair of these to Bluetooth into my Laptop for gaming. I play in sessions that run for 3-4 hours. Without fail, every game, these start to die after 90 minutes. The audio continues to work coming into the earbuds, but the microphone stops working. This is on a full charge, and I have to change my audio input/output. No more. This is garbage and anyone that tells you otherwise either works for this garbage company or is related to someone who is.

Battery life is not good at all. I recently bought 2 pairs, one for me and one for my daughter-in-law.

I read a lot of the reviews before the purchase. A lot said sound quality was good. Personally I all probably stay with my wire ear buds. Because the volume doesn’t seem to be loud enough I can hear people in the room and the base is non existent. Poor choice/decision by me.
"

Randomly disconnects every half hour or so and can only be resolved by putting the buds back in the cradle to power off, and then reconnecting. Exactly what you want to have to do while on a run, on an exercise bike, whike driving etc... They're just trash.EDIT: eventually after a time, they began turning themselves on randomly inside the cradle, and disconnecting me from the headphones I was actively using. The only solution to this problem was to smash these garbage earbuds between to concrete cinder blocks.
"
2927,"
Falls out and everytime you touch it, stops playing music, if you touch it again nothing. Tap it 20 times it will start music again..runner? Good luck, They will fall out every 2 mins and you can tell because the music sounds crappier, they are so far away from your ear drum as they will fall soon and you will never find them for a long time. So annoyed by this model..through them in the garbage.

I had these for a week. The first time I used them my phone paired fine with both ear buds. But now when I try to use them it will only pair to one of them.

Let me start off by saying I don’t leave bad reviews. If something is wrong I just return them and am done with it. But I feel very strongly to the point where I have to right a review. This item has great ratings! So I was expecting something of quality. In reality, the headphones constantly hang up the phone without me pressing it down for 2 seconds as the description says, does not last more than 2 hours before dying even after a full charge when I was looking forward to the long battery life it claims and the noise cancellation is nonexistent. Maybe I was unlucky and got a defective pair but I’m very disappointed in them in general.

If you only like hearing your music intermittently out of one ear at a time these headphones are just the thing for you.They play with below quality sound in one ear at a time (kindly giving your other ear a little rest) …. But watch out if you happen to turn your head even the slightest the tricky headphones will still only play out of one ear but switch back and fourth for a few seconds before deciding which ear (only one) deserves music.

The battery life does not last long. Every 2 minutes they disconnect and then connect. It says disconnecting/connecting every 2 minutes in your ear. I read it could be when it’s a low battery but even fully charged they don’t stay connected and it’s hard for people to hear you

I was excited to see that this product looked really nice when it arrived, and sounded good too. I used them for a day and a half and then left them to charge and after about an hour they suddenly exploded into a fireball off of my desk.

From the start, the left earbud was continuously dropping volume and turning off. When I tried to get some support, I was told I was wearing them wrong. One day, I wouldn't have any problem with them. More common is the experience I had just now wherein I tried for a half an hour to get the left earbud to actually work, and every time it turned on, dropped the volume, and powered off.The effort is not worth it, and I'll be buying a different set. The sound quality is good, but this is such a pain it's not worth the irritation.

These paired perfectly with my iPhone (and several other friends' iPhones and Android phones). I was testing them on different phones because the first pair became full of static and sound bounced right to left and cut out when I went for a walk with my phone in my pocket.I exchanged the first pair thinking maybe it was a tech. fluke. But the 2nd pair did the exact same thing with any phone. Sitting by the pool they were great. But connection cuts out constantly even when I was holding my phone in my hand while walking.

The ear piece is too big. They provide different sizes of ear pieces, but they are all super uncomfortable to the point I feel like I’m underwater. The sound quality is definitely 25 bucks worth. And don’t you dare try and adjust them, because you might change the volume drastically. Definitely pay a few more bucks for a better product.Edit: I’ve been trying to make these work. The ear pieces are too big and fall out of my ear. I’ll touch them to push them back in… because they are touch sensitive, it’ll pause what I’m playing or change the volume. 🤦🏻‍♀️

These headphones are great honestly, much better then any AirPod. But they do cut out sometimes & that’s only when you have the volume up more than half way.

These are probably the earbuds that have fit me the best out of all the ones that I have tried but the sound quality is just not very good. Most of the sound is very flat and the bass is not nearly as good as advertised. But my biggest problem is that these earbuds are very loud, even when I have my volume almost all the way off I find that its still pretty loud which makes them unusable when I'm trying to go to sleep. They also apparently do not offer returns so make sure that you really want these before you buy them.

I’ve been very impressed with my Beoplay H95 headphones, which I have been using for about 2 weeks. For context, I am a classical musician and record my own music. When researching BT ANC headphones, I sought out experiences by classical musicians, or people who listen to classical music, as the needs are different compared to other musical genres. Despite an extensive search I did not find much in this area so I am posting some of my experiences as they might be of interest to others.I use several different pairs of headphones, some for monitoring use in recording and editing, and others for sound checks and pleasure listening. It is unusual for any one headphone to serve all purposes! During recording, I generally use the tried and true and surprisingly inexpensive ubiquitous Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring. Most agree that these are very detailed and help reveal all the “warts” during the recording process, which is essential. However, I feel their sound signature is very bright and frankly unpleasantly harsh so they are not ideal for pleasure listening. I also use some excellent higher end headphones including the Sennheiser 800s, along with the companion Sennheiser headphone amp HDV 820, for critical and pleasure listening, as well as the Audeze LCD-X headphones which I use as a reality check during the recording process as well as for pleasure listening.With that context, enter the Beoplay H95. I purchased these for pleasure and convenience listening – as opposed to critical listening or recording - in a sometimes noisy home environment (lots of nearby heavy construction noise and leaf blowers nearly every day). I was seeking a pair of Bluetooth headphones with ANC that approached the higher fidelity of my other cans. After extensive reading of reviews of popular Bluetooth ANC headphones, for example Sony WH-1000XM4, Bose 700 and Apple Air Pods Max I decided to trial the Beoplay H95. Note that I did not audition these other lower cost headphones so I can’t realistically compare them to the Beoplay H95. However, I can compare the H95 to my higher end headphones and this may be of interest to some.Now, for additional important background, my use case is probably different than that of other headphone users. I don’t intend to use full size headphones walking about outdoors – I use Apple Airpod Pros for this. I also don’t intend to use full size headphones with ANC on commutes or on planes. Again, I would use the Airpod Pros or an older pair of Bose wired QC20 earbuds for this. So – my use case for a full size Bluetooth ANC headphone is for use indoors, freeing me from the cable tethering me to my good rig, listening for pleasure in a sometimes noisy environment. Other than ANC, sound quality is of paramount importance to me. Other features such as phone calls, apps, control gestures, voice control, are of secondary importance to me.I’ve found the Beoplay H95 sound signature to be very neutral and transparent. While clearly not as fine as higher end - and more expensive - cabled headphones, the sound quality that the H95 offers is quite respectable. The soundstage is fairly expansive, and while it may not be as wide or deep as the Sennheiser 800s (which is unusually vast) – the H95 soundstage is quite generous. This makes spatial location of different instruments, for example in an orchestra, better than in lesser headphones. The mid-upper frequencies are transparent and airy, and vocals, such as in classical art songs (e.g. lieder) sound very true and engaging. Instrumentals (piano, strings, orchestra) seem pretty accurate as well. Bass is tight and certainly present in sufficient quantity for classical music. It is not boosted or exaggerated as some might prefer for other genres of music. Recordings I’ve made of myself (i.e. me as performer) also seem pretty accurate. Of course, when I compare the H95 sound to my good rig, the difference is readily apparent – for example the Sennheiser 800s has a great deal more body, heft, clarity, liquidity, dynamic range and nuance where the H95 is a bit lighter weight, somewhat veiled, slightly grainy and compressed by comparison - but I feel overall the H95 does quite a very respectable job representing reality for a BT headphone.  Again, it is unreasonable to expect a BT ANC device to perform at the same level as much more expensive corded audiophile equipment. The H95 does come surprisingly close however!I have noticed what some others have called out, that to achieve decent listening volume, I need to dial the H95 up to >70% volume, which I feel is less than ideal and shouldn’t be necessary. For some softer classical tracks I need to dial it up to 90-100%. This suggests to me that there isn’t adequate headroom in the amplifier. The supplied USB-C to USB-A cable, intended for recharging the H95 battery, can also be used as a wired connection to a computer. In this case, the achievable volume is much improved compared to BT. I estimate that at 50% volume level in this wired setup is similar to 70-80% level in the BT configuration. A similar “boost” in volume occurs when using the supplied 3.5mm cable to the source, be it my iPhone 11 (with a lighting to USB cameras adapter), or PC. I believe the sound quality is also improved using the USB-A to USB-C cable, perhaps because the digital signal from the PC is bypassing the DA conversion in the H95. Another factor in the low volume output of the H95 via Bluetooth from my iPhone is EQ. Usually I have this set on “Classical” as that is the majority of my listening. However, I found that the EQ setting “None” (or “Flat” which seems equivalent) is still excellent sonically for my needs, and the volume is noticeably louder.I did have occasion to use the H95 in a phone call, and the sound was quite good at my end. At the other end, the sound quality was good enough for a hard of hearing elderly person to carry on a conversation better than when we use my land line.Regarding ANC – I agree with some other reviewers that while the dial on the left earpiece is handy for immediate control of ANC vs transparency, it would be nice to have a physical “stop” where it is obvious where the dial is minimized and where it is maximized. The dial spins freely so you have to judge based on your hearing to detect and set the desired amount of ANC. To be fair, they do offer audible tones instead of a physical stop, but you need to learn to “decode” the different tones. I found the ANC effective enough to minimize noise from construction next door through open windows, nearby washer/dryer noises, and even our land line ringing 3 feet away from where I’m seated was barely audible. Standing outside in my yard, a wood chipper being used 2 doors down was fairly noisy as one would expect. With the H95 on full ANC but without music playing, the wood chipper was about 80+% dampened, still somewhat audible. With music at low-moderate volume (~40-50%), the wood chipper was not apparent.Other Notes:- The dial on the right earpiece for volume is a brilliant feature in my opinion. Might be easier than APM's small knob. Incidentally, the small knob on the Apple Watch does control H95 volume when listening to Apple Music in an iPhone.- H95 has physical shut off switch, unlike APM, although the H95 has an ultra long battery life (38 hrs with ANC on and 50 hrs without ANC) making this less critical.- H95 has multipoint connection, allowing maintain connections to two Bluetooth sources, which means for example you can listen on one and make calls on the other- H95 has two corded options, both provided in the box: 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable (analog), and USB-C to USB-A (digital).- H95 has a real case, unlike APM. However, I feel it is useful mainly as a protective case at home, not practical for travel.- The Bang & Olufsen app is nice but not essential. I did not find the EQ options to be as useful as expected. I’ve settled on “Optimal” and have not found a need to change it. The variable option didn’t seem helpful or practical. The battery level indicator is useful to a degree, but due to the very long battery life, it doesn’t come into play much. On my PC Bluetooth section, the battery level is also indicated. The volume level can be adjusted on the H95 with the dial on the right earcup so the app is not needed for this. The app is a little glitchy on the iPhone – more than once even though it was paired (appears in Settings>Bluetooth and music plays through) the app sometimes paradoxically cannot detect the H95. I had to delete and reinstall the app more than once. There is no app for computers (just mobile devices) but sometimes the Bluetooth connection on my PC is glitchy with drop outs.SummaryWhile it is not fair to expect that Beoplay H95 would perform at the same level as corded audiophile headphones costing much more, I believe that B&O did right by most things that count to optimize fine sound quality. The only significant downside for me is the relatively lower volume level, requiring cranking up the volume >70%. Whatever this suggests about the amplifier design and relative lack of headroom, it is not a deal breaker in my mind. And even though the H95 is much more expensive than every other BT ANC headphone currently available, for me attaining this high level of sound quality was worthwhile. Of course, each person must make his/her own assessment and decision based on their sound goals and personal financial situation.

So i am kind of an Audiophile, own a bunch of gear including Audezes, Shures, Bose, B&Os and a couple of Amps and here is my ‘personal’ opinion and review based on my own Signature sound Profile. Everyone will have a different type of sound signature they like.Below are my Preferences and testing criteriaMusic: Deep house with cleaner bass , and Movie soundtracks (Hans Zimmer)Why did i need a new can?I was looking for something that can be portable, great sound quality. Great finish and interfaces, and BLUETOOTH with ANC!I tested the Focal Bathys, B&O HX and B&O H95Quality: The H95 wins this hands down. Both the Focals and HX felt cheap and plastic, and more disappointed on the Focals because its more expensive than any of the ones hereThe Metal and quality of H95 wins this. Great to touch and feel.ANC: i also have the Bose and if i compare the AnC with that, the bose wins. But compare the h95 to the other 2 here, H95 wins again.Sound quality: h95 has more base and punchy too, which is what i wanted for my deep house music. The focals did have more midrange, but not suitable for the kind of music i listen tooAccessories: again H95 wins. Love the metal box it comes it( though i will never use it) others were just cloth basedLooks: h95 looks sexy. Better than any of them.Portability: h95 is foldable and easy to carry. The others are notUsed Deezer and Spotify and Soundcloud to do the testing.For me, and the purpose i am looking to get- the H95 wins.Great product.

I YouTube'd for quite a while to determine the best wireless ANC headphones on the market.  The consensus among the high end headphones appears to be the H95.  After having them for a while, I'm going to have to go with a yes, they are very good.  The big advantage over the Apple Airpods max is they are noticeably lighter and seem more comfortable to wear.  Worth it?  For me, I guess the answer is yes.

I was very excited to use these as i've owned my Bose QC2 since 2019 and it was time for an upgrade. These headphones were the top of my list because... well.. B&O, who can resist this brand and it's quality? I mustered up about a grand for these beauties, but the excitement was short lived. I work from home and am constantly walking around from my bedroom office to kitchen, bathroom, etc. any time i would be further than 10 feet from my computer, the headphones would start distorting. i can overlook this, no big deal. my biggest hurdle was sound when i was simply walking with my phone on me, in a meeting. the sound would just disappear for several seconds at a time. i couldn't justify paying so much money for headphones that would drop connection like that as i've owned airpods, bose headphones and have never experienced it. i did research, tried to update firmware, etc., but nothing helped.sound is 11/10physical quality is 10/10connection is 7/10

I wanted to love these but there is now a very noticeable clicking or static sound in the right earpiece.  What a terrible thing for a court reporter.  I rely on these to hear doing Zoom depositions and to listen back when needed.  I'm sad.  Love the color and the design but they should not be having trouble for this price and this company.

I bought the Beoplay H95 for listening to music so that's what I will write about. I agree with many others that these sound better than most other wireless headsets currently available. There is always personal preference, but this set has solid performance that's hard to surpass. The sound is well rounded with sufficient depth and clarity and an appealing stage. Most people are particular about bass, and what this set delivers will appeal to accurate bass enthusiasts more than to those looking for bass boost. That said, there is plenty of bass for everyone.The app has an option to change the sound profile which made a pleasant difference to me as I like my sound more on the ""bright"" side. Likewise you can use this setting to make them sound as ""warm"" as your standard plastic phones. The H95 also support aptX which is an enhanced Bluetooth codec that made some difference on my Android phone.The noise cancellation on the H95 is not it's primary strength and not as good as on my Bose QC 35, but then again the sound is remarkably better. There seems to be some buzzing at whichever level you set it to, but it doesn't affect the listening experience. On the other hand, the transparency mode is a very useful feature, although these days fairly standard on noise cancelling phones. The controls make sense, less physical buttons and two integrated dials that are easy to operate.The H95 can be used as a wired headset, but to my surprise I didn't find a difference in sound quality between wireless and wired mode. Not sure what that says about either one. I did notice the low volume others have described, but it is definitely high enough for harm free listening and maybe that's what the makers intended. In any way, there is plenty of detail to make up for sheer volume. Battery life is so generous that I yet have to charge the set for the first time.In my opinion the H95 is a product with a purpose and the premium materials definitely help to set it apart. I would recommend it to anyone looking for cultivated listening, but the lingering question is whether it delivers what you expect for the price. At the end of the day, this set is in a class of its own.

From everything I've listened to these have the best sound quality of any wireless headphone - easily.  Makes my Sony XM4 headphones seem dark and noticeably lacking detail.  Previously Sony XM4s were at the top of most people's list for wireless cans.  Comfort-wise, the Sony's win (light weight and plus ear pads) but the B&O H95 are more luxurious and have a tighter seal.  ANC is similar - both top rate.Compared to my collection of wired headphones, the B&O H95 falls just below my lower tier audiophile headphones:  Sennheiser HD600 and HD650, HiFiMan Deva and Sony MDR-Z7M2.  And noticeably below my top-tier headphones Sony MDRZ1R, beyerdynamic T1 2nd Gen, HiFiMan HE6se and AKG K812 Pro.  I never expected this B&O H95 to challenge my best, but I wanted to see how close they would come.  Bluetooth just can't compete in a wired segment yet.The B&O H95 is very, very clear, has lots of detail, strong tight bass and textured highs.  I would consider it a mild to moderate V-shape which appears more pronounced because of the remarkable clarity they produce.  Sound stage is very good compared to my wired cans but the best I've heard in the Bluetooth arena.For portable listening I still prefer my wired in-ears: Sennheiser IE800 v2 and Westone W80 v2 and W60 v2.  Even with the larger drivers in the B&O H95, the clarity and quality of the Westone is better.  I actually consider my Westone W80 just a hair below my AKG K812 Pro and Sony MDR-Z1R (which are considered some of the best open and closed cans available right now).

I’ve been very impressed with my Beoplay H95 headphones, which I have been using for about 2 weeks. For context, I am a classical musician and record my own music. When researching BT ANC headphones, I sought out experiences by classical musicians, or people who listen to classical music, as the needs are different compared to other musical genres. Despite an extensive search I did not find much in this area so I am posting some of my experiences as they might be of interest to others.I use several different pairs of headphones, some for monitoring use in recording and editing, and others for sound checks and pleasure listening. It is unusual for any one headphone to serve all purposes! During recording, I generally use the tried and true and surprisingly inexpensive ubiquitous Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring. Most agree that these are very detailed and help reveal all the “warts” during the recording process, which is essential. However, I feel their sound signature is very bright and frankly unpleasantly harsh so they are not ideal for pleasure listening. I also use some excellent higher end headphones including the Sennheiser 800s, along with the companion Sennheiser headphone amp HDV 820, for critical and pleasure listening, as well as the Audeze LCD-X headphones which I use as a reality check during the recording process as well as for pleasure listening.With that context, enter the Beoplay H95. I purchased these for pleasure and convenience listening – as opposed to critical listening or recording - in a sometimes noisy home environment (lots of nearby heavy construction noise and leaf blowers nearly every day). I was seeking a pair of Bluetooth headphones with ANC that approached the higher fidelity of my other cans. After extensive reading of reviews of popular Bluetooth ANC headphones, for example Sony WH-1000XM4, Bose 700 and Apple Air Pods Max I decided to trial the Beoplay H95. Note that I did not audition these other lower cost headphones so I can’t realistically compare them to the Beoplay H95. However, I can compare the H95 to my higher end headphones and this may be of interest to some.Now, for additional important background, my use case is probably different than that of other headphone users. I don’t intend to use full size headphones walking about outdoors – I use Apple Airpod Pros for this. I also don’t intend to use full size headphones with ANC on commutes or on planes. Again, I would use the Airpod Pros or an older pair of Bose wired QC20 earbuds for this. So – my use case for a full size Bluetooth ANC headphone is for use indoors, freeing me from the cable tethering me to my good rig, listening for pleasure in a sometimes noisy environment. Other than ANC, sound quality is of paramount importance to me. Other features such as phone calls, apps, control gestures, voice control, are of secondary importance to me.I’ve found the Beoplay H95 sound signature to be very neutral and transparent. While clearly not as fine as higher end - and more expensive - cabled headphones, the sound quality that the H95 offers is quite respectable. The soundstage is fairly expansive, and while it may not be as wide or deep as the Sennheiser 800s (which is unusually vast) – the H95 soundstage is quite generous. This makes spatial location of different instruments, for example in an orchestra, better than in lesser headphones. The mid-upper frequencies are transparent and airy, and vocals, such as in classical art songs (e.g. lieder) sound very true and engaging. Instrumentals (piano, strings, orchestra) seem pretty accurate as well. Bass is tight and certainly present in sufficient quantity for classical music. It is not boosted or exaggerated as some might prefer for other genres of music. Recordings I’ve made of myself (i.e. me as performer) also seem pretty accurate. Of course, when I compare the H95 sound to my good rig, the difference is readily apparent – for example the Sennheiser 800s has a great deal more body, heft, clarity, liquidity, dynamic range and nuance where the H95 is a bit lighter weight, somewhat veiled, slightly grainy and compressed by comparison - but I feel overall the H95 does quite a very respectable job representing reality for a BT headphone.  Again, it is unreasonable to expect a BT ANC device to perform at the same level as much more expensive corded audiophile equipment. The H95 does come surprisingly close however!I have noticed what some others have called out, that to achieve decent listening volume, I need to dial the H95 up to >70% volume, which I feel is less than ideal and shouldn’t be necessary. For some softer classical tracks I need to dial it up to 90-100%. This suggests to me that there isn’t adequate headroom in the amplifier. The supplied USB-C to USB-A cable, intended for recharging the H95 battery, can also be used as a wired connection to a computer. In this case, the achievable volume is much improved compared to BT. I estimate that at 50% volume level in this wired setup is similar to 70-80% level in the BT configuration. A similar “boost” in volume occurs when using the supplied 3.5mm cable to the source, be it my iPhone 11 (with a lighting to USB cameras adapter), or PC. I believe the sound quality is also improved using the USB-A to USB-C cable, perhaps because the digital signal from the PC is bypassing the DA conversion in the H95. Another factor in the low volume output of the H95 via Bluetooth from my iPhone is EQ. Usually I have this set on “Classical” as that is the majority of my listening. However, I found that the EQ setting “None” (or “Flat” which seems equivalent) is still excellent sonically for my needs, and the volume is noticeably louder.I did have occasion to use the H95 in a phone call, and the sound was quite good at my end. At the other end, the sound quality was good enough for a hard of hearing elderly person to carry on a conversation better than when we use my land line.Regarding ANC – I agree with some other reviewers that while the dial on the left earpiece is handy for immediate control of ANC vs transparency, it would be nice to have a physical “stop” where it is obvious where the dial is minimized and where it is maximized. The dial spins freely so you have to judge based on your hearing to detect and set the desired amount of ANC. To be fair, they do offer audible tones instead of a physical stop, but you need to learn to “decode” the different tones. I found the ANC effective enough to minimize noise from construction next door through open windows, nearby washer/dryer noises, and even our land line ringing 3 feet away from where I’m seated was barely audible. Standing outside in my yard, a wood chipper being used 2 doors down was fairly noisy as one would expect. With the H95 on full ANC but without music playing, the wood chipper was about 80+% dampened, still somewhat audible. With music at low-moderate volume (~40-50%), the wood chipper was not apparent.Other Notes:- The dial on the right earpiece for volume is a brilliant feature in my opinion. Might be easier than APM's small knob. Incidentally, the small knob on the Apple Watch does control H95 volume when listening to Apple Music in an iPhone.- H95 has physical shut off switch, unlike APM, although the H95 has an ultra long battery life (38 hrs with ANC on and 50 hrs without ANC) making this less critical.- H95 has multipoint connection, allowing maintain connections to two Bluetooth sources, which means for example you can listen on one and make calls on the other- H95 has two corded options, both provided in the box: 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable (analog), and USB-C to USB-A (digital).- H95 has a real case, unlike APM. However, I feel it is useful mainly as a protective case at home, not practical for travel.- The Bang & Olufsen app is nice but not essential. I did not find the EQ options to be as useful as expected. I’ve settled on “Optimal” and have not found a need to change it. The variable option didn’t seem helpful or practical. The battery level indicator is useful to a degree, but due to the very long battery life, it doesn’t come into play much. On my PC Bluetooth section, the battery level is also indicated. The volume level can be adjusted on the H95 with the dial on the right earcup so the app is not needed for this. The app is a little glitchy on the iPhone – more than once even though it was paired (appears in Settings>Bluetooth and music plays through) the app sometimes paradoxically cannot detect the H95. I had to delete and reinstall the app more than once. There is no app for computers (just mobile devices) but sometimes the Bluetooth connection on my PC is glitchy with drop outs.SummaryWhile it is not fair to expect that Beoplay H95 would perform at the same level as corded audiophile headphones costing much more, I believe that B&O did right by most things that count to optimize fine sound quality. The only significant downside for me is the relatively lower volume level, requiring cranking up the volume >70%. Whatever this suggests about the amplifier design and relative lack of headroom, it is not a deal breaker in my mind. And even though the H95 is much more expensive than every other BT ANC headphone currently available, for me attaining this high level of sound quality was worthwhile. Of course, each person must make his/her own assessment and decision based on their sound goals and personal financial situation.

So i am kind of an Audiophile, own a bunch of gear including Audezes, Shures, Bose, B&Os and a couple of Amps and here is my ‘personal’ opinion and review based on my own Signature sound Profile. Everyone will have a different type of sound signature they like.Below are my Preferences and testing criteriaMusic: Deep house with cleaner bass , and Movie soundtracks (Hans Zimmer)Why did i need a new can?I was looking for something that can be portable, great sound quality. Great finish and interfaces, and BLUETOOTH with ANC!I tested the Focal Bathys, B&O HX and B&O H95Quality: The H95 wins this hands down. Both the Focals and HX felt cheap and plastic, and more disappointed on the Focals because its more expensive than any of the ones hereThe Metal and quality of H95 wins this. Great to touch and feel.ANC: i also have the Bose and if i compare the AnC with that, the bose wins. But compare the h95 to the other 2 here, H95 wins again.Sound quality: h95 has more base and punchy too, which is what i wanted for my deep house music. The focals did have more midrange, but not suitable for the kind of music i listen tooAccessories: again H95 wins. Love the metal box it comes it( though i will never use it) others were just cloth basedLooks: h95 looks sexy. Better than any of them.Portability: h95 is foldable and easy to carry. The others are notUsed Deezer and Spotify and Soundcloud to do the testing.For me, and the purpose i am looking to get- the H95 wins.Great product.

2022-04-18 MonI am:  Broadcaster  Musician  Acoustic Engineer  Loudspeaker Engineer  Recording EngineerHeadphone requires >2h burn in.  Before that headphone is terribly muddy....After two weeks:PROS+  Good isolation+  Good noise cancelling+  Great articulation relative to BlueTooth headphones, especially with bass, after some rolloff.+  Comfortable for >10h.+  5 Year Warranty+  Good BluetoothCONS– Not terrifically LOUD, barely sufficient in some cases.– Does not clamp head sufficiently for anything strenuous outdoors.– Bass Heavy, absolutely atrocious on this set. Complete tonal failure.  If you want accuracy, go to NeuMann NH20.  You are not going to find honesty with B&O.  BeyerDynamic Lagoon are a better alternative than B&O.RECOMMENDATION  Based on this review copy, these headphones are not worth the money at all with their gross deficiencies.  If you can stand to do the heavy EQ necessary, and love the two dial rings for volume & noise canceling, and money is not important, then ok. Otherwise, this headset is a royal pain.

Every audio company puts a priority on what matters to them the most in order to save cost. The B&O design and materials spared no expense, but the volume and clarity at high levels took a hit. I agree with other reviewers, the sound is very low and I had to listen at 70 percent to hit the music at enjoyable levels, however the vocals and other Mids took a hit.On the other hand, the XM5s look cheap and no where near pleasing to the eyes. However, they sound phenomenal over the H95s. If you want to flex on audiophiles or those in elites of society then they are for you. If you care about sound more, than I say get the XM5s.
"

I'm a headphone snob. I own several pairs and have used dozens throughout the years including all the popular models you may be familiar with. I use the Sony XM4s for my daily gym sessions along with the B&W PI7 buds. I think it's fair to say we've hit somewhat of a ceiling in audio quality in the last few years and it's very rare that I'm impressed or surprised by a new offering. The 95s... yeah. These baby's hit different. There's no sacrifice in audio quality under any circumstance. The low end is the most impressive aspect. Bass and sub bass on these completely blows away any other headphone I've used and it's not particularly close. It almost feels like a built in subwoofer, but unlike other bass heavy phones these never lose clarity and every detail is still present. There is no sloppiness in the low end. The mids are refined and excellent and the highs are crisp. Upon first listen you may not be blown away by the fidelity. It's when you go back and listen to other headphones that you will realize what you were missing. I was initially stuck trying to decide whether to purchase these or the Air Pods max (which I think are also excellent), for my daily at-home driver. While the APM have some advantages over the 95s the difference in sound quality was too great for my ears.

the sound quality is something indescribable, I thought I had good sound with other high end devices I own, I thought a bit to buy these for the cost, but I barely put it in my ears phew!  it is a balanced and powerful sound (it is something that I did not understand with the other devices) that had to increase more than 50% of the sound to hear the power, here I perceive it from the same volume, with a detail in instruments that I had not perceived before .  a sound worth its price.  I don't really care about the finishes and those details, in a few years I'll know if it's worth it and the planned obsolescence allows me to continue using it.the only half detail is the size of the headphones, maybe they could be a little bigger and my ears feel very fair, after three hours using them it doesn't bother me, but I have the impression that if the ears were freer the sound quality was better (with no desire to contradict the master engineers of B&O) remained married to his brand, may the successes continue.

I bought these for amazing sound and mic quality, I got what I wanted - here are other factors for others to consider.Pros:- Sound quality on an ANC Bluetooth Headphone doesn't get better, subjectively.- Build quality is large factor in price, feels luxurious, worth it.Cons:- Put in your AirPods, Bose, or Sony headphones, set volume to 80%, that's the max volume on these.- ANC isn't good, must set ANC/Transparency off in any sort of wind. Reminds me of 2013 Bose QCs.

I was fortunate enough to buy these at a discounted price.  I've owned a pair of H8s for years, and they're great--comfort, features, build and sound (good, punchy bass).  I was really expecting better with the H95s given the hype and price.  I was concerned when I read some reviews that indicated otherwise. Unfortunately, those reviews were true, especially of the sound quality.  The bass is not punchy and the sound is just above average.

I’ve owned the H9i for several years and been quite happy with them, so I was skeptical of the H95 at this price point. But after comparing the two side-by-side I’m keeping the H95 and selling the H9i. The H95 is an improvement in almost every category. The only negative I can find, versus the H9i, is the H95 are slightly heavier.Sound quality: Better. Overall clearer and I especially notice an improvement in the dynamics and transients.ANC: Much Better. This alone is worth the upgrade. The H9i’s ANC is just ok and narrows the soundstage significantly when enabled. The H95 corrects that flaw and has very little change in SQ even with ANC at max. You also control the H95’s ANC level and dial it to your liking. The H95’s ANC performance is also improved.Comfort/Looks: Equal. The H95 is heavier with a slightly more narrow, but also more plush, headband. Whereas the H9i has circular earcups, the H95 has oval/rectangular ones. I rate this a tossup for me and you’ll have to try for yourself. The lambskin earpads on both are amazing.Call quality/Transparency: Better. Hard to quantify, but the transparency mode sounds more clear and like the ANC you can dial the level to your liking.B&O listened to customer feedback and delivered an enhanced product. “Worth it” is subjective, but there’s no doubt they are an upgrade from the H9i.

After using the Bang & Olufsen H9's for a couple years I decided to try the new H95s. First off, the packaging was great. They come in a nice box and its a great experience opening. The case the headphones come in is very solid and has a little compartment inside with a 3.5 mm cable and USB C cable. The headphones materials are top quality and I loved the metal turn dials. I miss the quick transparency mode gesture from the H9s though. Unfortunately they couldn't handle heavy bass. I listened to some Deftones and Run the Jewels and got distortion from the heavy bass hits. Everything else sounded great.. Maybe I got a defective pair but my H9's sounded much better, are lighter, and more comfortable. Headphones are very subjective and I'm sure they've worked fine for other people.

These are the best sounding wireless headphones I have ever heard and I've heard them all.  When wired they are true audiophile quality headphones.  They are very comfortable, high quality build and sound so much richer that the airpod max (which I had).  it's not even close.  The noise cancelling is great, just not as good as the Max.  Maybe equal to the Sony xm4 (which is still excellent).  For anyone who really appreciates the sound quality the 95 provides, they are worth the price.  I have apple music lossless paired with a dragonfly DAC, so I am getting true lossless sound and it is amazing.  They actually sound as good as my home system at 1/8th the price.  Wireless still gives you great sound with AAC used by apple music, much better than spotify.  I don't use Tidal due to it's limited  content.  All the contenders (Sony, Bose, Max, ect are excellent headphones and mostly worth the cost, but the H95 are in a league of their own.

If you value accurate sound reproduction, you will love these headphones. Others are lighter, but that’s because you need good physical drivers and magnets to reproduce sound correctly. Digital enhancement is great, but you cannot defy the laws of physics. Adjustable noise cancellation works really well, and transparency mode is very useful when traveling. High quality materials, great battery life. Haven’t worn them on a trans-Pacific flight yet, but I’m confident they will serve me well.

I personally like the way they sound in comparison to the airpods max. And you can actually turn them off a concept that apple could learn from. I have tested them with the pixel 6 pro which defaulted to APTX HD. And the iphone which uses AAC. They both sound great. IMO the bass is good but it does not drown out the vocals/instruments like some other headphones. They ANC does not cause ear pressure like the sony XM4's. Some reviewers say the H95's are not worth the price but I feel it was worth it. I may not be an audiophile but I do consider myself a headphone snob at the very least. They are very comfortable to wear though I do not wear glasses. The build quality might be better on the airpods max but it also makes them more heavy. I think these are the best headphones you can get for having both wireless and ANC.

I wanted to love these headphones and if I didn't need Noise Cancellation I would give them 5 Stars. They are extremely well designed and built. The controls are B&O simplicity. I compared the Active Noise Cancellation of the Beoplay H95's to a pair of five year old Bose headphones my spouse uses. Even at the maximum ANC setting on the Beoplay H95's, there was noise present and not being cancelled. Music played at medium volume would drown out the noise however during quieter passages the noise was heard. The Bose did a good job cancelling the same noise. Since the return period will expire before I could test them on a flight, I am returning them and have ordered the new Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones.

After trying Sennheiser, audeze, hifiman, Sony, bowers and Wilkins, klipsch, and other brands I can’t remember, these finally hit the spot. Although sound is very subjective I would say these do many things very well. I’ve had them for a few months now and I still feel amazed when I find a song I haven’t listened to for a while.

I will keep them only because they are more comfortable than my $350 Bose 700 around my neck when I am not listening to music.  The audio quality is much better with these, high, low, and mid. If you are an audiophile, these blow my Bose and Sennheisers away. The volume is lacking, you won't be able to get it up to what I consider what most people would like, it will be kind of quiet to retail quality of sound. The comfort of the hardware however is great, same goes for noise cancelling (though not as good as the Bose). I like the tactile dials, but it is not as good as the Bose. All in all I would say you can save some money going for the Bose. If money is not an option, these are a lot more comfy, which is why I am keeping them.

I like the dynamic running through my ears, the sound is so realistic and the H95 sounds better than any other headphones. And I like the service that Amazon and Bang&Olufsen provided. It's the most perfect purchasing experience that I've ever had in my life. Thanks for Amazon and Bang&Olufsen.

Sound signature is one of its kind, but the noise cancellation is really poor. I couldn’t wear it in a flight and not comparable to the noise cancellation of Bose and Apple headsets. Even the comfort is really bad, I couldn’t wear it for longer listening times. But I have to give a 5 start for the sound signature, its inline any other headphones.

Please refer also to my review of B&O HX and Sennheiser Momentum 4 because I tested all three just about at the same time. In short I couldn't find a single reason not only to justify it's price but just to keep them regardless of it.This is very harsh, I understand but it is what it is. Just try them, I doubt their excessive weight and clamping force and less than ideal pads shape will win you. Give it a couple of minutes and you will find your self already thinking you want these things off. The unrefined sound will not help to get you to forget about the discomfort as well as the disappointingly low sound level they can reach.I love B&O but the H95 are totally unworthy. Returned. HX is a much better value for the money.

Honestly, if I am buying a almost 900 dollar headphone it better sound like a 900 dollar headphone , it should blow me away and I would be like , “what just happened here ? Are the gods whispering to me ?”That did not happen !I bought a AirPod Max as well to compare and yes I feel these are better but just slightly.The build quality is good not not great , I was expecting a lot more for a 900 dollar headphone.You can get a lot of videos about sound quality and unboxing and stuff in YouTube so not going to waste time about that here. At the end of the day it needs to “wow” YOU not anyone else. It should put a smile on your face after a hard days work, that did not happen for me.And gosh , made in China , really for 900 ? That kinda curbed my enthusiasm a little bit.

When using this product keep in mind that when taking calls or using a communication app like discord it changes to a crappy audio output instead of staying at stereo which is a shame. I wish I could disable that and enable the mic without the poor quality audio output. Battery is absolutely great.

I am 6ft man. My head is not considered a huge head however it is proportional to my height and build. At the maximum setting the upper part was pushing so tightly downwards giving me an instant headache. B&O clientele are tall people! Not sure why their headphones was built for a kids size head

Sound is great,  but at this price point I expect the headphones to pair — and remain paired — seamlessly to my iPhone and/or iPad.  Worked ok up until the latest B&O software update (April 2021).  Now, no matter how many times I go through the instructions, while the H95 will pair to my devices, it drops within 20 seconds or so.  It then randomly pairs on/off, but will not remain paired, rendering these headphones useless for work or play.  Exact same behavior whether iPhone or iPad.  Unacceptable.  Way beyond return window, so now all i can do is use a hardwire connection and wait til B&O provides yet another software download…fingers crossed.

I have several pairs of headphones including 10+ pairs of Bang & Olufsen headphones among other brands. The sound from these headphones is the most pure and amazing I've ever experienced. Was sad because I'd just received a pair of HXs 2-3 weeks prior. Although the HXs were awesome compared to the H9 gen 3s, they were nothing compared to the H95s.I get they're pricy. However, if you can do it, do it. They are absolutely phenomenal.Ok. Updated review. The headphones are definiteIy worth five stars. The company? One star and only because I have to provide them with at least one star. I had a defective pair. Sent them back for service. After over two weeks of sitting on the headphones along with ridiculous and nonsensical interactions, B&O informs me the headphones are no longer available in black. No longer available. So now they are trying to force me to pick a color I do not want. Not sure how this is going to end, but at this point, it ain't pretty.

I bought these headphones about 2 years ago.They’re the best I’ve ever had. Easy connectivity, great app management, beautiful, strong ANC. Oh, and they sound way better than anything else with great battery life.My only complaint is the carrying case. It’s enormous. The point of folding cans is portability. The aluminum case is great in that it offers protection for very expensive headphones but it takes up too much space in the backpack, both in footprint and in thickness. If there was a smaller aluminum case I would buy it in a heartbeat.

Not worth it. They sell the experience of luxury not actual sound quality. Mids and highs get mixed up at higher volumes and bass explodes in the worst way posible. You could get better sound off of $30 headphones.

These are the best made and best sounding Bluetooth headphones you can buy. As other reviewers have pointed out the sound out of these, for Bluetooth, is just not right. It just shouldn’t be this good.These are for people who appreciate that extra refinement in sound quality with the build quality too.Soundstage is great for closed back wireless. Better than some open back cans.Imaging and instrument separation is great.Bass is solid and refined.Overall sound signature is refined, balanced, and just pleasant in the best way.ANC is good but not great. Transparency mode is good but not great. Both are very functional but not Apple, Bose or Sony level.Mics are very good. I have used these for hours on Teams calls and colleagues say I sound clear and great.Battery is great.These will not replace my HifiMan Ananda but, for me, when I’m working and my kids come home from school or I’m back traveling they allow me to get as close as I can to my desktop system. That, for me, makes this worth the money.Not for everyone but the right use cases. Enjoy!!

There is just something in the air when you hold something that feels so premium. Once you open the package and see the metallic carrying box and pull out the headphones you will feel the rush of satisfaction. Premium leather headbands with metal casing, the fit and finish is fantastic. The dials on both earcups are meticulously finished and do not feel wobbly like some others tend to be that uses dials for controls.Once you put them on your head, you will feel comfortableness. If even that's a word. The removable earpads feels like clouds against your flesh. And all of this without being too heavy. I was afraid it would keep sliding off my head due to the heft, but not at all. It's by no means flimsy light, but theres a good balance to it. Even the included charging cable and airplane jack screams of premium quality.Now onto the function. Sounds great, not the best for these over ear category headphones that I've tried in the pas, including Bose and Sony, but has great lows and crisp highs. The app allows some very shallow editing of the EQ. The ANC is ok, not up to the heavyweights but passable. On the other hand, the Ambient pass-through is pretty weak and does change up the sounds of the content you're playing. Sounds robotic. I would say mid-level at best.The bass is nice and rumbly without distorting, but the volume is a tad bit low for my liking, so bassheads probably need to go elsewhere. Like most audiophile type equipment, the sounds are geared towards balanced and clean.Battery life is fantastic, worn them for a few hours a day for over 2 weeks and still about 35% left. The app is polished and clean (vs the cluttered look of Sony's), although a bit lacking in functionality.Now does the premium construction and above average sound output worth over $800 to you? If you want to be different, yes, but if not, then I would stick with the consumer heavyweights out there, mainly Sony and Bose. Beats not need apply.

I'm not an audiophile, but I LOVE having a good collection of random headphones and earbuds so I can stay connected. I've got Galaxy Buds, Bose QC Earbuds, Beats Solo Pro 3, etc., so, I've had a lot of different products to get used to and really put through the ringer. Which is why it's taken a bit of time for this review to come out: I've put these things through the proverbial ringer.First and foremost, these things LOOK incredible. Though it's a shame that the blue plastic feels off the top of the earphones (as it looked eye popping, slick, and happens to be one of my favorite shades of blue), it doesn't do anything to take away from the overall elegance of the product. The presentation is spectacular: a heavy metal case, a hard cloth interior (with special compartment for aux chord, charger, etc), and a slot built so the headphones have a nice snug (but not too snug) place to fall right into.Second, the comfort. These things feel super light while on your head, and the noise cancellation is immediate, as the cups do truly seal off the outside noise. When you try to remove them from your ears, you can feel a slight, almost imperceptible, tug (in NO way uncomfortable), as it's almost as if they are magnetically attached and you're just breaking that magnetic seal. It's so minor but so important, because it proves that these things are serious about noise cancellation.Third, the sound. I used a recent album to really test out the quality of these. I listen to rock and metal mostly, so I listened to Chevelle's new album NIRATIAS. I'd listened to this album at least a dozen times before I got these and from the first few seconds, I noticed an immediate difference. The basslines of the first song were rumbling like a freight train and never went away. Now, I noticed the bass before, but this took it to a whole different level, and that's what I found on the rest of the music I listened to: the clarity is incredible. These make those Beats Solo Pro 3 sound like dollar store earbuds from 2010, and I like those Beats too.Finally, the battery. I received them at 50% a couple weeks ago, and after numerous hours of listening at work on and off, they are now down to 25%. Incredible.The price tag is high, but if you really want some quality headphones and can afford them, it's hard to tell you not to here. They are, quite simply, THE best I've ever used.

The quality of b & O has suffered over the years.I purchased my first B & O Beogram in 1976 and it is still woking as well as the day I bought it. Theese headphones are not worth the money and the sound quality is poor as well as the sound cancellation. And they have poor bluetooth connectvity with is constantly dropping.

Update: Sept 7 2021. The B&O 95 continue to be amazing. I've had these on my head every day since they  arrived. These are silky smooth. The ios app sucks and it can never find the headphones, but I mainly use these with my PC anyway. The sound though. SO GOOD! I do have a complaint and that's the head band. This thing bites into the top of my head and I have to take them off after an hour or so and take a break. These need better and more padding.--Original review: I have an entire wall of headphones because - reasons. Recently I've been loving the Sony in ear wf-1000xm4 and my beloved Sennheiser HD650s are always in arms reach at my desk. Since the Bang and Olufsen H95's arrived, I haven't listed to another headphone.These are LUSH. The sound manages to come at you in a wide sound field that encompasses my ears. The drivers in this headphone are flat out amazing. They are mostly neutral, but they also have a distinct V shape, which I personally love. The sub bass is sublime and rolls off effortlessly into mids. The treble sparkles and even though there is a bare hint of sibilance I forget about it.The H95s are built like a tank and even though I haven't tried Apple's new high end headphones, they would have to be seriously amazing to compete with the Beoplays. The ear cups are made of lambskin and they are, like the headphone sound, lush.To match the price, these arrive in a seriously impressive case that has the cables inside under a flap. The headphones fold up and fit perfectly. I've been leaving them out on top of the case because the headphones look that nice.Noise cancellation is top-notch and it handily challenges Sony and Bose. The nobs built into each speaker control noise cancelling on the left, while the right nob rolls the volume up or down. I don't use these for phone calls or for the voice assistant (I don't use that on any headphone) so I can't speak to their abilities.I've never had a pair of wireless headphones that did it all like the H95s, and I suspect I'm going to be listening to these for many years to come. These are absolutely worth every penny.

These are very pricey for what you get -- so if cost isn't an issue these might be great headphones for you -- they do have a few limitations though.A few things I've noticed (I've used quite a few headphones, but mostly the Bose QC35's).* Bluetooth range, significantly better than the Bose, I can get most of my house with these, and left them on once by accident and they connected out in the yard even.* Comfort.  They feel a bit heavier than the Bose QC35's, and I think they are, but they are still quite comfortable -- just as much as the Bose -- which has been my biggest drawback getting headphones, all day comfort.  I can wear these all day without issue.* Sound -- These have a really nice sound, deep bass, music punches through, one of the highlights.* Dials/Switches - These are ok, I wish they had a play/pause button, but the headphone volume is nice, and the noise cancellation level is nice.* Noise Cancellation -- reviews say this is just ok, but I think it's quite a bit better than the Bose -- so a step up there, but haven't tried the Sony's XM4's which are supposed to be much better now.Now some of the low lights:* Wish they had an automatic sensor when you took them off to pause your music.  I feel at this price point they should.* The tap to pause on the ear cup is super annoying -- it doesn't always work, and when it does it's slow.* Pass thru audio -- I wish there was a button to press to turn on mics to quickly hear someone.* Price -- you already know this, but it's priced double what competitors are -- and I think you get a step up on sound quality, but you're also unfortunately missing a few features -- so not sure I can recommend at this price.

There is no denying that B&O is all about luxury, unique design language, and quality. With the H95, B&O is celebrating its 95 years in the audio industry, which places a rather high bar on expectations.Upon opening the packaging, the level of care taken is immediately apparent. In the box, you are met with a hard aluminum case with the B&O branding. While great-looking and obviously highly protective, it makes it less portable, especially when carrying it in a backpack. Included are a soft cleaning cloth, an airline audio adapter, a braided 3.5mm, and a USB-C to USB-A power cord. These are high-quality accessories as expected. It might not be important, but I loved the brand-new smell coming from the case.The H95 headset itself is certainly a piece of art. The light grey and aluminum design scream premium aesthetics, and the build quality is unquestionable. I appreciate that there is no stitching on the headband this time and is quite flexible. The aluminum arms are easily adjustable but still retain a good level of rigidity and are totally foldable. The swirl-brushed aluminum sides pleasantly reflect light. Breaking away from the traditional B&O round cup design, the (thankfully) removable earpads have an oval shape and are made of lambskin, which in my experience, gets better with use (I still own and use the original wired H6). If there is anything to nitpick, is that they may be susceptible to getting dirty quickly.The H95 features a combination of touch and physical controls. Typically, this can be confusing but I think B&O has a good balance here. Power, pairing, and the voice assistant are assigned to buttons. While B&O is not the first to do it, the volume and ANC levels are controlled by a rotatory dial on either cup and feel intuitive in my opinion. Play, pause, and call answer/reject are controlled by tapping the right cup, which feels natural. Controlling tracks works by swiping back and forth and works faultlessly.I found the H95 very comfortable. The headband padding is enough to ease head soreness and the incredibly soft lambskin feels like pillows on my ears -even when wearing glasses. There is good depth in the ear cup, which allows my entire ear inside. I did notice a bit of clamping force, especially on the upper jawline, but went away soon. Although they are a bit heavy, I was able to wear them for about 3 hours at a time (I do not like to keep headphones on for too long) without fatigue.The battery life is impressive. B&O claims up to 38 hours of playback with ANC on and a whooping 50 without. Since I got them over a week ago, I have not charged them once, which should take about 3 hours.Featuring Bluetooth 5.1, the H95 is future-proof. Pairing is super easy with the “Google Fast Pair”, iOS pairing, and “MS Swift Pair”. They also support SBC, AAC, and aptX Adaptive so I was not able to pick up any lag when watching videos or playing games. I was able to maintain a good connection at decent distances while walking around my medium size apartment. I am very pleased that this headset has a multipoint function, as I was able to go from my iPad to my phone seamlessly with no hiccups.Most importantly (to me at least) is the sound quality. Sure, the sound signature is subjective, but I am happy to say that the H95’s 40mm drivers do not disappoint. The bass response is well defined, punctual, but still felt. There’s restrained sub-bass that adds body without getting muddy. The midrange takes center stage as vocals, rhythm instruments, and dialog comes in clearly. The treble soars without being harsh or fatiguing. There was no noticeable sibilance. The 20-22000Hz frequency response allows for sounds to come through that usually fade in other headsets. The soundstage and channel separation are also impressive. I was able to pinpoint where the sound is coming from and even depth, giving the impression that I was in a large open space. I must say that it is quite the experience no matter the music genre or content, as I found myself looking for nuances and detail that I might have missed before, especially with lossless/HD sources.The adaptive Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes work very well. With a neutral ANC setting, I was able to drown an annoying neighbor’s lawnmowing to the point where I had to pause the music to see if he was done. Switching between ANC and transparency modes, and adjusting levels is as easy as rotating the left dial (nice!)Just in case you are not fully satisfied with the sound, it can be further customized with the B&O app. Speaking of the app, you can adjust the ANC, update firmware, and other settings. It is not as robust as I would have liked but gives enough options to make it a worthwhile companion.So, is the H95 worth the higher-than-premium price tag? For the casual listener that is looking for something more affordable with similar features, perhaps not. For the person that wants exceptional build quality, jam-packed features, intuitive controls, functionality, and a Hi-Fi sound signature -all within the unique and luxurious B&O design, absolutely!

Bang and Olufsen are world renown for making superb audio products with prices that will make your head spin and your bank account go into the red. However that being said, these headphones are pure bliss and an exquisite listening pleasure. The sound is impeccable and the fit is comfortable. A word of caution, these are not casual headphones.

The best of the best, the best sounding, best looking, top notch quality headphones on the market.  Sound quality is as close to perfect as I have ever experienced, no matter how loud or quietly I listen to music.  It is immediately obvious that the highest quality materials went into building these headphones.  From the beautiful aluminum storage case that these headphones come in, to the lamb skin leather, these headphones are well worth the price.  Bang & Olufsen H95 headphones are the epitome of amazing sound quality combined with luxury and build quality.  Noise cancellation is perfect, whether I am using it at the gym, while running at the park, or while walking downtown, I hear only what I want to hear, Bang & Olufsen got it right!These Bang & Olufsen H95 headphones are a culmination of 95 years of advancement, and it shows.  These headphones are simply a large step ahead of any other headphones I have ever listened to.

These are really nice headphones but it's simply way overpriced.The sound is good but nothing that will blow your mind and I have bluetooth headphones that have just as good and better sound at less than 1/3 of the price.The materials use is without a doubt really nice and the build quality is top notch.  No complaints here at all.Zero issues with quality.  These are built very solid.My problem is the price.At this price everything about this should blow me away but it simply doesn't.I feel like these should be about half the price they are now.Price aside, everything works good and the sound is nice and balanced.For me it's got just the right amount of bass.  Not too much and not too little.If you are a basshead however,  I think you will be disappointed with these.  The bass is in no way missing or lacking but it doesn't have the head thumping bass that a basshead would be looking for.It has a well balanced sound but nothing that blows me a way.  And at this price, it should.These headphones are a bit heavier than most bluetooth headphones but are still comfortable to wear for hours without any hotspots for me.I like the hardcase it comes with but it's a fingerprint magnet.  I wish they would have used a different coating that wasn't such a fingerprint magnet.Ultimately, these are really nice bluetooth headphones but at this price, everything about it should be perfect and blow me away but it simply doesn't.

To commemorate 95 years of business in the audio industry, Bang & Olufsen released the Beoplay H95 in 2020.These headphones combine cutting edge tech, with excellent materials; to create a product that looks, feels, and sounds great!The Lambskin Leather Earpads have a rich smell which I personally enjoy, but may not be suitable for everyone. The smell is not artificial at all, and has continued to last, even though I've worn them for many hours.The earpads are magnitized to the headphone, which is a nice touch. This makes an upgrade very simple when it's time to replace them.These headphones are powered by a 1200 MAH battery. I have easily gotten the 38 hour battery life with ANC active, with volume at low to medium levels. Without ANC you can expect 50 hours of battery life, and it takes 3 hours to recharge the headphones from 0-100%.While there is no quick charge information available for the headphones, consider that if the headphones can last for 50 hours in passive mode, then 15 minutes of charging could provide approxamately 4 hours and 17 minutes of playback. not to shabby.The Active Noise canceling is top notch, and you can dial in your preference to get the right amount of noise cancelation you prefer. There are quiet beeps which are heard once you hit the maximum ANC level. There are 2 dials on the headphone, one on each earcup. The left dial, when turned backward, activates ANC. Turn it forward, and the noise from the world around you is quietly introduced.There are also beeps to indicate once you've dialed the ambient mode to it's max setting.The ambient noise sounds very natural when piped in to the headphones. I was able to enjoy music and talk with my Brother while lying in a massage chair, and had no trouble hearing him or the music.The Dials are subtlely placed on the headphone so they aren't easily bumped unintentionally.The left earcup also has a button to activate your phone's assistant.The right earcup contains the power switch, hold this switch after powering on the headphones to enter pairing mode.There are touch controls on the right earcup for play-pause and track navigation. Every control feels natural and intuitive.press once to play or pause, twice to move to the next track, 3 times to move to the previous track. press once to answer and end calls, press and hold to reject calls.The volume dial is on the right earcup. Turn forward to raise, and backward to lower.The Headphones are also capable of multipoint, which means they can connect to 2 devices at once.call quality was good with these.No one complained: or asked if I were on speaker phone, Bluetooth, ETC. Most background noises were not picked up while I talked.The headband is very flexible but not flimsy. It can be adjusted, and provides great support.Maximum comfort is easily achieved thanks to the easy adjustment of the headphones. While I do prefer click by click adjustments on the headphone arm, it is easy to identify the best fit. The earcups move smoothly up and down the aluminum rails, and easily stay in place once you've found your prefered fit.the case feels very premium and closes via a magnet. Inside are the Headphones, a 3.5 MM Audio cable, USB-C charging cable, Airline Adapter, product literature and Cleaning cloth.Bang & Olufsen stands behind the Beoplay h95 with a best in class, 3 year Warranty.Noise canceling is quite effective.low rumbling noises are reduced or illiminated to a significant degree. Fan noise is also greatly reduced, and voices are as well. With music at low to medium volumes I was able to completely focus on what was coming from the headphones. This was also true for podcasts and audio books. I haven't flown with these yet, but I have taken a noisy Commuter train a few times and wearing these has been a treat.The H95 support SBC, AAC, and APTX adaptive bluetooth Codecs. For Android phones that don't have APTX Adaptive, the H95 will connect via standard APTX, AAC, or SBC.There was no delay between audio and video connected via APTX Adaptive while paired to my LG V60. I can walk through my apartment with no issues, and a multi story home, in both cases leaving my phone on a desk while I walked around.The Beoplay app, available for both IOS and Android, allows for customizing the sound via eq presets.I almost always mess with the sound of any headphone I use, even though I enjoy many different sounds and tunings. With the H95 however, i haven't played with the sound presets once. I quite enjoy the default tuning.One trait I've observed in Headphones from B&O is the feel of a bass drum or kick drum. It feels genuine and almost speaker like. meaning to my ears, it has the feel and sound of what I hear in full range speakers.it has a satisfying affect on the rest of the mix.Aside from this, Bass feels very lively and controled on the H95.There is great texture and level of bass all throughout the lower frequencies.Occasionally there have been situations where I would like just a hair more definition accross the midrange, to give the headphones a bit more energy to guitars, but more to Brass instruments, then some Woodwind instruments, in that exact order. But this thought is not constant, and I only want this in certain situations.As is, the mids are pretty even in and don't randomly spike or feel harsh or sharp.Treble is very pleasant with this tuning. Sure some things could sound a bit more realistic, like crash symbols, but generally speaking, this is a well tuned, refined sound signature that does well with whatever you throw at it.Bang & Olufsen emphasize that every detail is important.Whether it's the high quality braided cables, the straps that hold them together, the clean design of the case, the ridges of the aluminum dials, the smell of the earpads, the natural sound of Ambient mode, the emphasis on canceling out a wide swath of noise, or the premium tuning of the Audio drivers, nothing about these headphones was ignored or implemented without the big picture in mind.When you buy the Beoplay H95, you get a Headphone that combines the best in technology today, with the timeless craftsmanship Bang & olufsen has used from day one.

 Attaching a video that shows a fault in the noise cancelling that causes the headphones to emit a high-pitched, loud noise. This happened with two sets (B&O replaced my first one). Then they claimed this was “by design” and that the workaround was to turn off the ANC feature.They also confirmed this was the same mechanism used in all their headphones. Their words:“the active noise cancellation feature, which can be turned off via the steps here, has no design flaw as the iteration used in the H9 3rd Generation was also used in other headphone models with no issues reported on them either.”

I just received the H95 and I have owned the APM for around 6 months now. Before the APM, I owned the Sony WH-1000XM3 for several years and this was primarily used for my frequent business trips to Asia as well as within the US. For this purpose, the Sony was just fine - kill the noise during the flights - but the sound wasn't up to snuff considering that I'm an audiophile with headphones like the Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC and RAAL SR1a being driven by Chord TT2 DAC, Mscaler and TToby amp as well using Audeze LCDi4 and a custom JH Audio Layla IEM for mobile. So, I'm one of those crazy audiophiles (although I decided enough is enough and that I've reached my endgame for that kind of stuff) and decided that I need to really upgrade my collection of mobile true wireless ANC headphones and earphones.Compared to the Sony XM3, the APM was definitely a big upgrade in almost every way - especially the sound but in usability as well. For me, the comfort wasn't quite as good as I expected and it has moisture condensation issue in the ear cups that become bothersome after an hour or two so that has started frustrating me. That's when I started looking at alternatives. I've been through the Sony and Bose QC route over the years and wanted to move on from those although they are fine for what they are in their price points. So I looked at the pricier options from the likes of M&D, B&W, and Mont Blanc before deciding the APM made the most sense. The ANC is great and the sound is very good but I just couldn't seem to bond with it. I liked it but I didn't love it.Enter the B&O H95 on my radar. At first, I rolled my eyes at the price but, heck, the Abyss headphone with its TOTL cable is almost 10x the price of this and needs another $17K worth of DAC, amp and cables so it could very well be a ""bargain"" in comparison. Plus, I can take it on my business trips and RV/camping excursions as well as use it at the office (at work and at home) without being tethered by a cable while enjoying pretty decent sound quality. That was my hope and plan and, I have to say, it has worked out exactly to my expectations. The H95 is great and addresses all of the shortcomings - however small - of the APM.The build quality is excellent as expected and has all the necessary features and I do like the dials to adjust the volume and the ANC level although the small dial on the APM is fine as well. Most of the time, I have the ANC set to the max and that's fine. I think the ANC on the H95 is excellent and very comparable to that of the APM and the Sony XM3. Comfort is definitely better on this for me than the APM. Not sure what it is about the APM but it just doesn't seem to conform to my head as well as the H95. I'll need more time with the H95 to reach a verdict but, after a few hours, it still feels good and I don't have the annoying condensation I've been experiencing with the APM.Sound-wise, which is the most important factor, the H95 isn't going to compare to TOTL ""summit-fi"" headphones from the likes of Abyss, RAAL, Hifiman, and Audeze that I own or have owned in the past but this is just in a different category and price point. That being said, I'm quite impressed with the overall sound quality of the H95. Even coming from that absurd segment of the audiophile world, I can say that I'd be happy with the sound quality of the H95 for most of the day and relegate the expensive stuff to occasional serious listening sessions when I'm willing to be chained with cumbersome cables to a morass of boxes connected by a spaghetti mess of more cables.The H95's sound is very clear, balanced, neutral, and spacious with a deep but unobtrusive bass. The soundstage is by far the best I've heard on an ANC wireless headphone and the imaging is also excellent with nice separation between the various instruments. The midrange is full-bodied and very natural sounding. The treble has just the right amount of shimmer and never gets grating, no matter what kind of genre I play. I mainly listen to classical, jazz, acoustic and ambient electronic although I will sometimes dig out my old rock, metal, and pop kinds of stuff. I prefer a very balanced sound without any specific bands of frequencies being emphasized and the H95's sound signature delivers exactly that.I still plan to keep the APM and I'm sure my wife will use it more often than I do now. I guess it's basically hers now. Overall, for me, the H95 is just so much better - especially in regards to the sound but also in comfort - than the APM. To me, the sound of the H95 is easily superior although the APM is no slouch and is certainly much, much better sounding than the Sony XM3 which I've now passed onto one of my sons. My wife and my sons get my leftovers. Haha.In conclusion, the H95 is everything I expected it to be and, for me, it's definitely worth every penny. It seems that it will still be some while before I can go on my quarterly 2~3 week business trips to Asia visiting suppliers and customers or even within the US with this unending pandemic situation but the H95 will be great at home and in the office as well. Very pleased with the H95 and I highly recommend it to the audiophile types who want to get the best possible ANC wireless headphone. This being said, I fully understand that $850 can seem kind of ridiculous when there are very good options like the APM, XM4, Bose 700 and other great brands like Bowers & Wilkins and Master & Dynamic. If you can allocate the budget, do go for it. It isn't perfect but it pretty much checks all the boxes.

I have many audiophile grade headphones, which are all excellent in their own right, but let me tell you these headphones are nothing short of stellar. The sound that comes out of these 40mm drivers shouldn't even be possible! Do they have the head rattling bass? No, but the bass they reproduce is so tight and precise that the whole audio band is elevated and not muddied in the slightest. Also, holy sound stage and imaging! They are also stunning to look at and feel like two little clouds when placed on your head. Not that my wallet would want it, but I would gladly pay $1000 for this masterpiece!

I auditioned Momentum 3's, Shure Aonic 50's & Apple Pro Max's. I also have two pairs of Momentum 2's that are both near or at the end of their lifespan. Of them all, past and present, the B&O H95's are subjectively the best BT headphones I've ever heard. It's odd b/c I didn't like the way they sounded out of box. They sounded average at best. A week later and it looks like I'm going to keep them. I'm guessing the increase in sound quality is due to burn in or brain in. Anyway, one of three concerns is the EU limiter, as the volume is extremely low. The second are the ear-cups, they’re shallow and don’t completely envelop my ears. The last is price. Do I really want to spend this much for a pair of BT headphones. Only time will tell, but it looks like I'm going to keep them.16 Jan 2022: The EU volume limiter proved to be too much for my ears. Speaking of which, the ear cushions proved to be way too stingy as well. Return label requested.

Those are the the best headphones I ever had, sound is just fantastic without even touching EQ, this is a masterpiece, they are expensive but worth the price, Im not sure but I think you wont find better headphones. I had those headphones for test: Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX, Bowers & Wilkins Px7, SENNHEISER Momentum 3, Master & Dynamic MW65, Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro but H95 are the King of the universe :). They are a little smaller than B&O HX which I don't like. I have big head and they are tight on my head, HX are more comfortable but sound quality is more important for me so I chose H95. I love them.

I bought these because I travel alot and needed some nice new headphones and I've always had great experience with other B&O products. Honestly these headphones are by far the best I've ever weilded or used. High attention to detail. The hinges and sliders all feel very solid and high quality. The ear muffs easily come off to be replaced. Amazing sound quality. Crisp and clear and the bass isn't overbearing like I was worried it might have that vibration behind it you can hear in alot of other headphones. Just the right of amount of bass to feel hitting the way you want from a pair of headphones. After about a week of use both for calls, travel, music, and gaming. The only two things I noticed is I have not been able to get them to connect to the B&O application to adjust any of the headset settings. Stock is amazing as is. But hopefully they fix this in an update.

These are by far the most expensive set of ANC headphones I have.  Sound quality is great for a pair of wireless headphones, but nowhere near a similar priced wired headphones.  These do sound really good, open soundstage with very clear high, mids and lows.ANC function is just a gimmick, I think most of the headphones are about the same.  But unlike the B&W PX7, these won’t give me a headache while using the ANC function.These are made with very high quality materials and the penalty for that is weight.  You’ll feel every bit of it during long listening sessions.  Padding on the ear cups are very soft and comfortable, but they are on the small side.  It is small in size and shallow in depth, bigger ears will touch the edges of the ear cup and the drivers.Battery life is great so far.  It had been out performing the advertised numbers.Overall I am very happy with the product, these are my go to headphones for short trips and casual listenings.

I have been searching for a pair of high quality ANC headphones with apt-x low latency codex built in so I can use them to watch my TV via a FireStick and or Apple TV without any audio lip sync delays for a while now and I have finally found the only pair that can give me what I have always wanted with awesome ANC to boot! These are hands down the best sounding and best ANC headphones I’ve ever used and I own the Sony XM4’s and the Bose NC700’s (FYI neither Sony or Bose have low latency codex’s so they are unusable for TV viewing since the lip sync is HORRID).My first attempt at having some higher end headphones was with the Air(Pod Max’s (aka APM’s). I just went through three (3), yes three, different sets of the APM’s and each of the three failed within 25 days of everyday normal use. The failure seems to be linked to the moisture buildup in the ear cups that eventually causes the transparency button to short causing the transparency mode to switch on, off, on, off, on, off over and over and over constantly. No amount of factory resets or soft resets would fix the problem and even after getting AppleCare+ and getting a replacement pair those too failed. So far Apple refuses to acknowledge this major design flaw so when you use up all your replacements with AppleCare+ you’re on the hook to pay out of pocket for repairs which can really start to add up.Anyway, after going through 4 months of the APM failed experiment I came across these BeoPlay H95’s and was intrigued by the reported level of ANC they offered and the high end design. They seemed to check all the boxes of what I was looking for and having apt-x low latency Bluetooth was a must have in my situation so I decided to plug my nose and pay an additional $250 over the APM’s and oh boy am I glad I did. The quality, ANC and comfort are next level. They feel a hell of a lot lighter on my head than the APM’s did and when I move my head around they stay in place unlike the APM’s. Also, there’s an actual on/off button and the dual dials for volume and transparency mode are way nicer than the design of the APM’s. Also, being able to connect to my TV and my phone simultaneously is just icing on the cake for me compared to the APM’s where you could only connect to one device at a time. Oh and the battery life….WOW…it just seems to last for days and days on one charge using them at least 6hrs/day.Conclusion: Avoid the APM’s at all cost (you’ve been warned) and “buy once, cry once” and get these headphones. You won’t regret it!

This is the first time I purchase B&O. In the past I have tried many model of them but I decided not to buy because the sound dynamic quite too light for me. But not for H95, sounds are crisp, great dynamic and wide range of sound.So impressed and glad I decide to buy.

Great build quality. Easy to set up and connect to my iPhone. Good ANC. You can adjust EQ and settings with the downloadable app. Great soundstage and extreme highs and lows. Comes with nice aluminum carry case. Volume control through the app, your phone or there is a large nov integrated into the earpiece you can turn to adjust volume on the right and the one on the left adjust the degree of ANC or transparency. I’m happy with them.

 Like most, the cost of the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones kept me from trying them. I first bought and loved the Beoplay HX headphones but kept feeling something was lacking. I had to adjust the EQ regularly to “fix” the sound as it would sometimes be too harsh in the high end or the bass might distort a bit at high volume. Also felt the round ear cups were not ideal for creating a seal to allow the noise cancellation to do what it is supposed to do. The H95’s were still the ones I wanted, ever since I saw them announced but the cost held me back. Finally I had to give in and ordered them and I can honestly say I do not regret it. They are without a doubt the best sounding wireless headphones I have tried and I have tried many, many wireless headphones over the last two years. I currently own the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX, The Air Pods Max and the Technics A800 Headphones. The H95’s blow them all out of the water, at least for me.Sound is subjective, everyone hears things differently but for me these have the best sound out of the box of any I have tried. I also tried models from Sony, Bowers & Wilkins, Master & Dynamic, Sennheiser and more. These sound so good, with incredible depth, detail, and the soundstage is immersive and clear. Bass is strong but not overwhelming. Those seeking heavy bass might be disappointed but I think it sounds just right. Others have said they think they don’t get loud enough and I can hear that, definitely older tracks that have not been remastered will show off the weakness in the recording but for me most everything I have listened to sounds awesome and for me they are loud enough. The noise cancelling is surprisingly good, especially when music is playing it blocks a good amount of outside sounds. No doubt some are better (like Sony or Bose) but these are up there near the top of the list. Also the build quality is the best, really beautiful looking headphones, starting with the aluminum case they come in, the braided cords that fit into the compartment inside the case (with leather snap straps to hold them) and the headphones themselves are made of premium materials like aluminum and leather and fold up to fit inside the case. The ear cup pads are held with magnets and are easy to remove and replace (like the Air Pods Max do) and the oval shape lends to better sound isolation and comfort. These headphones just feel like something luxurious on your head. They have a little more clamping force than the HX which some might have issue with but I found it perfect as the HX’s felt more loose and like they might fall off my head at times (although they haven't as of yet). The Titanium drivers allow for better sound than is found on the HX (which are still good, just not as good, especially in direct comparison to the H95’s). Battery life is very good, as expected, but individual mileage varies on usage, volume and ANC settings and such. And i do love the dials on the ear cups for adjusting volume (right ear cup) and ANC/Transparency (left ear cup). It’s a nice touch. The only fault I can really find with these headphones is the touch control can be finicky for sure, but usually works, and there are no wear sensors to stop/start playback when you remove/replace the headphones but since this feature doesn’t always work properly on some headphones I have used I don’t really need it. If price is not an issue, I highly recommend the H95 headphones…If cost is an issue, I still love the HX and they do have wear sensors, and they are a slightly more reasonably priced alternative, especially when on sale. I cannot say enough good things about the H95’s and the Bang & Olufsen brand! I am spoiled now and will be hard pressed to use any other headphone! I haven’t even tried them wired as of yet, I hear they are great wired too, but I really only want to be free of wires, otherwise why buy wireless headphones? As they say “you get what you pay for” and I think these headphones are well worth it!Update: decided to try the H95’s wired and they sound simply  incredible! I’m truly impressed. You do have to use power when wired so there is that to take into consideration and that may be why the wired sound is so awesome! I would not normally use them wired but it’s nice to have as an option, especially as good as they sound. And as mentioned above, the cords are durable braided cords for longevity and endurance. A really nice touch! One thing I discovered: the assistant button is supposed to be a long press to activate your assistant, in my case Siri, but it did not work at all. It’s supposed to be a long press to activate and a double press to cancel or deactivate, so I tried the double tap and it worked to activate Siri, at least on my unit. So if you find the long press not working, try the double tap. (I don’t really use it that much anyway but it’s good to know it does work after all). Update: a recent firmware update has improved the responsiveness of the touch control, it will pause/play quicker than before with less of a delay in the sound starting or stopping. Still my favorite wireless noise cancelling headphones!

I was lucky enough to get B&O HX on Amazon prime day deal for a bargain price of £300.From the moment I put the HX on i was blown away by the build quality,sound and even the noise cancelling.But I was always curious as to why the B&O 95 were £750.... £300 more than the HX (at full price) and when looking at the specs didn't seem to have £300 worth of differences.Both use the same drivers.Both made from the same materials.Both using the same Bluetooth codecs.But my curiosity got the better of me so I decided to order a pair to see if I was missing something.On arrival I will admit the unboxing experience is the best I have ever had.The box they come in is very premium and looks like it's holding a premium product inside.The headphones carry case is all metal and looks amazing but not so great if you intend on using it to travel as it will scratch very easily and dosent fold down flat when not in use so takes up a lot of room in a bag.When you open the headphones case you are treated to a very nice looking pair of headphones.B&O Tradition oozing with style.These headphones look stunning and are very well built.The rest of the accessories in the box.. charging cable,audio jack and flight adaptor also follow suit with premium materials used.You know these headphones are made to last year's and years which I must admit is something I really like from B&O.But after testing do I think they are better than the HX and worth the very premium price.Well it took me all of 2 hours to make my mind up.Sound.......Sound is subjective and what I like you may not so I'm just going to say that I love the sound of the HX and the 95 sound exactly the same.I was very surprised but disappointed by this. As I said I love the sound of the HX but was expecting to be blown away by the 95'sThe only thing I could tell after doing an A/B comparison is the 95's have a bit more bass but I don't think it's to do with driver tuning it's coming from the fact that the 95's have oval earcups and a stronger clamp force than the HX which helps with bass reproduction.Other than that both headphones get plenty loud and sound crisp clear and have a great soundstage.Battery.95s have a better battery lasting 38 hours compared to the 35 hours of the HX.Noise cancelling...Noise cancelling on the 95's are better than the HX but not by a mind blowing amount.ControlsBoth headphones use a combination of touch controls and physical buttons. Few differences between the 2 is that the 95's use dials located on the earcups to control sound and also ANC.Turn the right dial and that adjust the volume and use the left dial to adjust the level of ANC/Ambient sound.Great idea but when using them the dials felt like they were scraping a bit and didn't feel butter smooth which I was expecting but still did the job.The HX on the other had use the touch pad for volume(rotate your finger around the outside of the touch pad increases/decreases the volume).Fornthe ANC you have a button on the left cup which when pressed cycles through the ANC/Ambient or off modes.Both use the touch pad for track skip,paly/pause and to answer and reject phone calls.One advantage the HX has over the 95s is auto pause.So when you take the HX off your head when listening to music they will stop playing and then resume when you put them back on.Was very surprised to see that the 95's don't support this feature.Weight.Neither headphones are very heavy but the 95's have the heavier of the 2 which I did notice but was possibly due to the fact I have been using the HX for a week prior but it didn't cause discomfort.Final thoughts.When comparing the 2 as I have done I can't recommend these as for the price the differences just don't add up.Better battery (just)Better ANC (just)Build and sound (same)Honestly if you are considering these headphones give the cheaper HX a shot. I guarantee you won't be disappointed and you will still have a loads of cash left to buy the wife/husband something nice to and even take them out for tea 😁Thanks for reading and I hope this helped in your purchase decision 👍

Avevo le Bose QC 35 II, ma posso dire che solo da oggi ascolto veramente ogni strumento della mia musica preferita, grazie alle H95. La qualità del suono è da brividi. Ma il volume massimo è troppo basso. Mi sembra strano che un prodotto di questa fascia di prezzo non ti dia la possibilità di andare oltre il necessario e il raccomandabile, quando se ne avesse voglia.Ma non si può in tutta onesta parlare male di questo prodotto. È una meraviglia.Per passare da un dispositivo all’altro fra quelli abbinati, bisogna spegnere manualmente quelli che non si vuole ascoltare; in base al prezzo pagato, uno si aspetterebbe una app con questa funzionalità (stile Bose).

Vorab, Sound ist wie Schönheit und Kunst im allgemeinen Geschmackssache, subjektiv sowie individuell. Jeder hat so seine eigenen Vorstellungen wie die Musik klingen sollte, damit sie als perfekt bezeichnet werden kann.Als Zuspieler für die Bewertung dienten ein Onkyo Granbeat dp-cmx1, FiiO X7, Surface Book 2 und Pixel 6 Pro (Onkyo HF Player). Die Musikdateien lagen ausschließlich in FLAC von HD bis UHD vor und wurden per Bluetooth sowie Kabel an den Beoplay gesendet. Für das Streamen wurden Qobuz und AMAZON genutzt. Zum Vergleich habe ich den Bose 700 ANC, DUNU DK 2001, Onkyo E900, FiiO EX1, Beoplay H5, H9 und den Technics EAH AZ60 hinzugezogen.Der Beoplay H95 ist B&O typisch ein Design Produkt, welches sich optisch und vor allem in der Materialwahl stark von der Konkurrenz absetzt. Entgegen dem Groh an Kopfhörern besteht der Beoplay zum Großteil aus Metall und echtem Leder, während sich bei der Konkurrenz das Verhältnis exakt umgekehrt verhält und viel Kunstleder zum Einsatz kommt, einfach nicht vergleichbar. Die Bedienung via Lünetten für ANC und Lautstärke sind ebenfalls bei keinem anderen Kopfhörer zu haben und funktionieren perfekt. Tipp-/Wischgesten für vor/zurück/Gesprächsannahme usw. finde ich besser als Taster, schließlich haben alle IN EAR Kopfhörer ebenfalls diese Funktionen, warum nicht auch OVER EAR Kopfhörer!?! Sehr gut gemacht B&O. Diese Art der Bedienung hatte mir schon bei meinem 4 Jahre alten Beoplay H9 1.Gen. seht gut gefallen (tipp und wisch Funktionen). Auch hat mein H9 noch keine Alterungserscheinungen an den Tag gelegt, weder musikalischer, materialer Art noch was den Akku anbelangt. Bei Kopfhörern mit Kunstleder Ohrmuscheln habe ich schon das eine oder andere Mal gehabt, das sich das Kunststoff auflösende Gebrösel an Kopf und Ohren klebte und ich aus diesem Grund auch nicht den Technics EAH A800 geordert (Bestellung zu Gunsten des H95 bei AMAZON gecancelt) habe. Ja, aufgrund der hochwertigen Materialien und der Verwendung von Aluminium ist der Kopfhörer nicht gerade leicht, trägt sich aber sehr angenehm, ohne das man den Eindruck bekommt, einen schweren Kopfhörer aufzuhaben. Das liegt zum einen an den sehr gut die Ohren umschließenden Hörmuscheln (habe keine kleinen Lauscher) und dem gut gepolsterten Bügel. Die Verarbeitung ist ausgezeichnet! Kein knacken oder knarzen wie beim Bose 700 ANC (Kunststoff und Kunstleder wohin das Auge sieht, aber auch viel leichter!).Bevor ein musikalisches Urteil über einen Kopfhörer gefällt werden kann, sollte dieser min. 20 Stunden betrieben worden sein. Technik braucht immer etwas Zeit um sich Einzuspielen, im besonderen Kopfhörer wie auch der Beoplay H95. Nach der Einspielzeit klingen die Kopfhörer ohne Anpassung des EQ (via Beoplay App) für mich bereits perfekt. Sehr schöner, exakter Tiefbass, lebendige Mitten und präzise Höhen. Das Klangbild des H95 ist sehr ausgewogen und bildet eine große Bühne ab. Hierbei sind die einzelnen Instrumente lokalisierbar und man kann ihnen während der Wiedergabe verifiziert folgen. Sehr gut klappt dies bei Otis Taylor / Nasty Letter, Evanescence / Synthesis, Steve Jablonsky / Transformer: Age of Extinction oder Thorbjorn Risager & The Black Tornado / Best Of. Klassik, Dance wie auch Rock oder Pop klingen sehr gut und für mich besser als beim Bose 700 ANC sowie Technics EAH AZ60. Der Bose hat zwar auch den Tiefbass, zeichnet ihn aber nicht so sauber ab wie der Beoplay H95. Auch wenn die DUNU DK 2001 und Onkyo E900 vier Treiber für die Abbildung der Musik nutzen, ist der Sound nicht so harmonisch wie beim H95 und Stellenweise bei den Höhen überspitzt (zuweilen unangenehm wie bei der Wiedergabe von INXS Songs).Das Pixcel 6 Pro hat sich zudem als sehr würdiger Zuspieler für alle Kopfhörer beim Vergleich herausgestellt, solange die Onkyo HF Player App genutzt wird! Die Poweramp App kommt klanglich nicht an die Onkyo App heran, egal ob die Musik per Blutooth oder Kabel (DAC zu USB C notwendig) zugespielt wird. Die bei einigen hier abgegebenen Bewertungen bemängelte max. Lautstärke des H95 kann ich nicht bestätigen. Vermutlich liegt es hierbei an der verwendeten Player App, den Geräteeinstellungen oder dem Streaming Dienst. Ich konnte diese Erfahrungen ebenfalls machen und würde empfehlen, am Smartphone einen andere Player zu verwenden und die Bluetooth Einstellungen zu überprüfen.Die Multikonnektivität ist wie bei den Technics EAH AZ60 sehr praktisch, wenn man mit dem Rechner sowie Smartphon zugleich verbunden ist und während einer Filmwiedergabe auf dem Rechner problemlos das Telefongespräche annehmen kann.Neben der sehr hohen Verarbeitungsqualität, der Optik sowie Haptik war ein weiteres Kaufargument die lange Akkulaufzeit. Hier wurde ich nicht enttäuscht und die angegebenen 38h werden bei meiner Lautstärkewahl problemlos erreicht. Leider ist der Akku nicht mehr wie beim Beoplay H9 eigenständig wechselbar.Ja, 800,- € sind eine menge Holz für einen Kopfhörer, aber er ist aus meiner Sicht und in Anbetracht der verwendeten Materialien, der Verarbeitung und dem Klang das Geld wert. Wer einen wertigen, langlebigen und sehr gut spielenden Kopfhörer sucht, dem kann ich den Beoplay H95 empfehlen.

Ich hatte den H95 neben dem Bowers&Wilkens P7 S2 zwei Wochen intensiv in Betrieb. Musik hören über PC, iPhone 11 und meinen etwas in die Jahre gekommenen, aber immer noch hervorragenden Digital Audio Player Astell&Kern KANN - jeweils über Bluetooth und über Kabel. Dann noch viele Telefonkonferenzen über Bluetooth mit dem iPhone und dem PC - zumeist allerdings in eher ruhigen Umgebungen.In Kürze: ich fand den H95 sehr ausgeglichen und angenehm im Klang. Mehr Bass (für mich manchmal etwas zu prominent aber nie schwammig) und vielleicht etwas weniger Details speziell in den Höhen als der P7 S2, aber insgesamt sehr präzise und nie anstrengend. Bei längeren Musiksessions fand ich den H95 insgesamt harmonischer und schöner als den P7 S2 und auch angenehmer auf dem Kopf. Allerdings sind das am Ende nur sehr kleine Unterschiede und beide gehören sicherlich zu den besten ANC Bluetooth Kopfhörern die ich bislang gehört habe - und da waren einige von Bose, Sony und Sennheiser dabei. Ich würde sagen, zwischen H95 und P7 S2 entscheiden am Ende für mich die persönlichen Präferenzen was das Klangbild angeht (H95 wärmer und mehr Bass, P7 S2 etwas luftiger und eine kleinen Tick präziser in den Höhen).Ich habe trotzdem beide zurückgeschickt. Neben dem Musikgenuss muss ein ANC Kopfhörer bei mir sehr gute Leistungen beim Telefonieren und in Videokonferenzen bringen. Insbesondere die Verständlichkeit für den Gesprächspartner bei der Verwendung in nicht ganz ruhigen Umgebungen ist für mich von hoher Relevanz. Beide Kopfhörer machen da in ruhigen Umgebungen eine guten Job, wenn es um mich herum lauter wird kommen aber zunehmend Nachfragen vom Gesprächspartner. Es geht zwar auch dann noch, aber die Leistung ist nicht ganz auf dem Niveau meines aktuellen Bose NC700 und sicherlich deutlich schlechter als beim neuen Sony XM5. So gut wie mein aktueller Bose NC700 sollte ein neuer ANC BT Kopfhörer aber in dieser Disziplin definitiv sein - insbesondere bei den für den H95 und den P7 S2 üblicherweise aufgerufenen Preisen. Also geht auch der H95 zurück obwohl ich ihn tatsächlich für ‚nur‘ 568€ auf Amazon bekommen habe. Üblicherweise liegt er ja bei 700€ oder mehr und dafür ist er meines Erachtens einfach nicht gut genug.Sobald verfügbar werde ich den angekündigten Bowers&Wilkens P8 als potentiellen Kandidaten mit meinem mittlerweile mit einiger Verzögerung eingetroffenen neuen Astell&Kern SE180 DAP testen. Obwohl die Nutzung für Konferenzen und Telefonie sich - zumindest wenn man die technischen Spezifikationen zugrunde legt - wohl nicht erheblich von der Leistung des P7 S2 unterscheiden wird. Ich bin gespannt …

Ero abbastanza indeciso se acquistarle, dato il prezzo non indifferente, anche con lo sconto del Blak Friday. Possiedo già le B&O H9 che già suonano piuttosto bene, e le Sennheiser momentum 3, che pure sono delle buone cuffie. Cosa mi ha spinto a prenderle?  Devo dire che già amo il suono definito e pulito delle B&O, poi avendo letto comunque delle più che buone recensioni sulle H95, alla fine mi sono deciso. E non mi sono pentito.Le cuffie sono comode, anche se un po' grandi. La portata del bluetooth è ottima, vado in giro per tutta casa senza che perdano il segnale. E infine il suono... Devo ancora finire il rodaggio di una quarantina di ore di ascolto, ma già la differenza con le altre cuffie bluetooth che possiedo si sente, eccome. Ottima spazialità e scena sonora, ottima definizione dei timbri e dei bassi, che sono caldi ed avvolgenti. Naturalmente dipende molto anche dalla sorgente sonora per avere il miglior risultato, ma ascoltate con dei file a 24 bit in Hi Res in alcuni brani sono spettacolari. Provato ad ascoltare la versione 2022 di Comfortably numb di Roger Waters: stupefacente la ricchezza del suono e la qualità dei dettagli. Ascolto anche molta classica, e il finale del terzo atto della Walchiria di Wagner nella registrazione di Solti è stato davvero emozionante. C'è chi ha lamentato il non alto volume raggiunto, ma francamente non ho sentito il bisogno di alzare il volume al massimo. Vado spesso a concerti dal vivo, specie con strumenti acustici, e conosco bene suoni e volumi di strumenti musicali e voci non amplificati. A me interessa la pulizia e la qualità del suono, e con le H95 l'ho trovato. Non ho termini di paragone con le cuffie cablate, poiché per mia comodità preferisco le bluetooth. Però penso che fra queste ultime sono probabilmente la scelta migliore che uno possa fare. Buon ascolto!!

Ich ersetze mit dem H95 Kopfhörer den ebenfalls schon sehr guten H9 3. Generation. Tatsächlich liegen Welten zwischen den beiden Kopfhörern was Tragekomfort und Klang betrifft.Bereits das Öffnen der Schachtel und das erste Öffnen der Metallbox sind ein absolutes Erlebnis! Die Wertigkeit der Materialien ist auf allerhöchstem Niveau und erfüllt so höchste Ansprüche. Noch nie wurde ich haptisch und optisch so überwältigt - auch wenn man das bei einem derartigen Kaufpreis erwarten muss! Das setzt sich beim Entfalten und Aufsetzen des Kopfhörers fort. Das Leder, die Metallapplikationen, die Tasten und Schalter: Alles wirkt edel und höchstwertig.Das Koppeln und Einrichten über die B&O App funktioniert tadellos. Die Oberfläche der App gefällt mir sehr gut. Die Einstellmöglichkeiten sind klar gegliedert und leicht verständlich.Zum Einstellen des Klangs werden einige voreingestellte Presets angeboten. Man hat aber auch die Möglichkeit den Klang über einen frei bewegbaren Kreis in verschiedene Ebenen zu bewegen und so die Abstimmung des DSP zu beeinflussen.Verglichen mit dem auch schon schweren H9 sitzt der H95 um ein Vielfaches besser. Allein durch die längliche Form der Hörer und die deutlich weichere Schäumung des Kopfbügels verbessern den Tragekomfort erheblich. Trotz seines unfassbar hohen Gewichts ist stundenlanges Tragen kein Problem.Endgeil finde ich auch die Drehringe an den Hörern, mit denen sich links ANC und rechts die Lautstärke einstellen lassen.Erstes ProbehörenEinziger Kritikpunkt vorweg: Die maximal wählbare Lautstärke stellt im Bluetooth-Betrieb leider nicht zufrieden. Erstaunlicherweise gibt der H95 auch bei Verwendung mit Klinkenkabel viel zu wenig Power aus. Bei dem H9 konnte ich mit Kabel eine deutlich höhere Lautstärke erzielen und damit die wahren Qualitäten des Kopfhörers nutzen.Das mag sicherlich am verwendeten Ausgabegerät liegen (iPhone 12, ipad pro, dell inspiron g7), doch im Alltag hat man selten einen Kopfhörerverstärker oder einen AV-Receiver bei sich. Ich wünsche mir einfach mehr Punch! Dafür ziehe ich einen Stern ab! B&O ist nicht der einzige Hersteller, der zu wenig Lautstärke bietet. Es scheint ein allgemeines Problem zu sein - wahrscheinlich zurückzuführen auf Verordnungen durch Gesetzgeber zum Schutz der Allgemeinheit.Der H95 spielt kraftvoll und klar. Es gibt keine Frequenz, die der Hörer nicht kennt. Einfach jedes versteckte Detail kommt zum Vorschein. Es ist ein absoluter Genuss mit dem H95 Musik zu hören. Dabei spielt es keine Rolle, welche Musikrichtung man wählt. Einfach alles wird perfekt wiedergegeben.Kraftvolle und tiefe Bässe, nie dagewesene Details aus Mitten und Höhen. Chapeau! Ein Kopfhörer, der die Musik so wiedergibt, wie es sich die Studios vorstellen.Das ANC lässt sich in 5 Stufen einstellen. Verglichen mit dem Bose 700 Kopfhörer empfinde ich das ANC als gleichwertig und somit besser als beim H9. Ein tolles Feature ist die Funktion „Windgeräusche unterdrücken“. Damit funktioniert ANC bis zu einem gewissen Grad auch dann, wenn man sich beispielsweise auf dem Balkon aufhält und Windböen vorbei wehen.Bleibt nur das Manko der zu geringen Lautstärke. Wer es so wie ich gerne lauter mag, der wird zumindest in Verbindung mit Smartphone, Tablet oder Laptop enttäuscht werden. Ich werde ein Update geben, sobald ich den H95 mit einem Kopfhörerverstärker getestet habe.UPDATEDer Betrieb mit einem Kopfhörerverstärker von Neoteck brachte kaum Besserung. Bevor ich die Lautstärke auf ein gewünschtes Niveau bringen konnte, fing der Verstärker bereits an zu verzerren. Als würde der Kopfhörer das Eingangssignal bewusst auf das vorgesehene Limit absenken. Bei einem derartigen Kaufpreis ist so etwas m.E. nicht hinnehmbar. Daher schicke ich den H95 zurück.

Une réduction du bruit pas au niveau des ténors que sont Sony, Apple et Bose.Il ne rechigne pas au niveau qualité audio, sa restitution est très ample et riche.Qualité des matériaux utilisés pour la construction du casque.Confort va être variable, de mon point de vue, avec le port de lunettes cela devient gênant avant une heure d’écoute.

update:  I've had an ear-cup fall off a couple of times while removing these headphones.Maybe a combination of hot weather, a bald head and weak magnets are too blame but a bit annoying on an expensive pair of headphones like this.Deducted a star.First and foremost I bought these for the audio quality, a detailed and airy sound with plenty of controlled bass when needed. Just amazing how far bluetooth headphones have come in recent years.Next plus would be the build quality...materials and construction that will, hopefully, stand the test of time (well, at least the a few years, unlike some previous headphones I have used).I also really appreciate having a physical on/off toggle  and the volume/anc dials...take those any day over press and hold type affairs.Now for a couple of negatives:The price. ouch. Got these on prime day sale (below £600) but, for me, still at the very outer reaches of a justifiable price for bluetooth headphones.The volume and anc dials, while superior over touch or press and hold buttons, feel cheap and out of odds with the build standard of the rest of the headphones.The ear cups could be a little bigger, a bit  of a snug fit but otherwise a comfortable wear.I think the good battery life and bluetooth connection are now pretty much standard and much less of an issue/selling point on previous generations , though still thankful for both.That's about it, would definitely recommend if within your budget.For sound reference I have had a Bower's PX (buttons stopped working), PX7s (hinge broke) and Sennheiser Momentum 3 ( recently started getting constant static in one cup) plus a Hifiman Sundara and a few other headphones, amps and such.

Parto dal fatto che la mia scelta e dettata esclusivamente dalla qualità del suono che le cuffie sono in grado di riprodurre fedelmente, tutto il resto è irrilevante per me.Raramente ho sentito dei suoni così dettagliati e puliti come con queste B&O H95 e considerando che sono molto esigente posso confermare tranquillamente che valgono i soldi spesi. Sono veramente soddisfatto. Un suono corposo, immersivo, pulito e ricco di dettagli. Queste cuffie sono adatte ad ogni genere di musica. Qualcuno critica che  non raggiungono volumi altissimi (da sballo) ma devo dire che non si sente l’esigenza dato l’ottimo lavoro dell’ANC, ed inoltre, personalmente do più valore all’alta qualità del suono che al “rumore” riprodotto da tante cuffie in commercio. Riascolto i miei album come se fosse per la prima volta. Eccezionale.

Vengo de unos Sony WH-1000XM4.Tras dos días con estos auriculares volví a coger mis antiguos Sony y parecen un juguete, de verdad.En comparación con dichos Sony, la cancelación de ruido es algo peor, pero compensa en todo lo demás (en los viajes de avión por ejemplo, recuerdo que la de los Sony era más eficiente).El acabado es increíble, cosa que también hace que pesen más que los Sony que están hechos de plástico, pero lo prefiero así.En resumen, muy contento con la compra, teniendo en cuenta, claro, el precio en oferta al que he tenido la suerte de comprarlos.

Da appassionato di alta fedeltà ho provato diverse altre cuffie over-ear di altri produttori (Sony e Bose principalmente).Sulla qualità dei materiali produttivi anche il meno esperto si rende subito conto dell'eccellenza dei materiali costruttivi (decisamente no vegan) che differenziano queste cuffie ancora prima di accenderle ed abbinarle al proprio dispositivo.Che dire, stiamo parlando di un prodotto super premium che, anche se testato con connessioni bluetooth a 256kbps fa sentire da subito la differenza con altri prodotti di fascia medio alta (parliamo di cuffie da 350/450 in su). Qui i materiali utilizzati e il software di gestione B&O fanno sicuramente la differenza, non c'è da discutere.L'equilibrio che si percepisce (senza mettere mano all'equalizzazione) è senza uguali. Bassi pieni, caldi, avvolgenti, eleganti... medi e alti puliti e ben bilanciati. L'app di B&O permette poi di adattare in una maniera semplice ed immediata di lavorare manualmente sull'equalizzazione in base al tipo di brano che si ascolta.Uso Apple Music e ho testato diversi tipi di brani sia in formato loseless, che master e in Dolby Atmos, nonostante i limiti del bluethoot (v. 5.1) la differza si sente rispetto a piattaforme come Spotify.La presenza di ghiere meccaniche per agire sul volume e sulla cancellazione del rumore/trasparenza sono la ciliegina sulla torta su un prodotto che, a parer mio, rimane il migliore sul mercato. La qualità ha un prezzo ma in questo caso, direi che ne vale decisamente la pena.

Also klar, das ist eine Menge Geld die aufgerufen wird. Ich kann jetzt nur mit dem Sony WH-1000XM3 vergleichen und das ist schon ein großer Unterschied. Angefangen von der Haptik und dem Sitz, bis hin zum Klang. Der Hörer vermittel das Gefühl von hochwertigen Materialien und er sitzt nahezu pefekt (das ist bei mir eher schwierig. Genial die Steuerung des bluetooth players, das funzt richtig gut, gerade was die Lautstärke betrift. Ich füttere den H95 mit einem Sony  NW-A105 und alles mögliche von Rock, Pop, Jazz. Der Hörer hat eine feine, breite Bühne und löst sehr klar und differenziert auf. Da höre ich Details die dem Sony verborgen blieben.Einzig die Geräuschunterdrückung ist mäßig. Die kommt weder an den Sony noch an einen Bose irgendwie ran. Ja es ist eine gewisse Geräuscjunterdrückung da, aber eben nicht in dem sinne wie beim Sony bei dem man den Eindruck hat man ist in inerisloierten Blase. Also da hääte B&O besser investieren können.Aber gut ich behalte ihn trotzdem, einfach weil der Klang einmalig ist. Ob es andere Hörer für weniger Geld gibt die den gleichen Klang bieten können..... kann ich nicht sagen, ich gönne mir den jetzt und fruee mich auf jede Gelegenheit ihn aufzusetzen.

Build Quality - Amazing, including a aluminium carry case. Bit bulky for use on the fly, but definitely protects them if you need to throw them in a bag etc.Sound Quality - Almost as good as some high end wired options.

ANC is very good, but if that's your main feature you're looking for, the Sony XM4s and 5s would be a better choice. Still decent tho.Overall, really happy with these and enjoying using them.

Ich habe auf der Suche nach nem Ersatz für meine Sony Wh1000mx3 mehrere Kopfhörer ausprobiert. Der Beoplay 95 war der mit Abstand teuerste von allen. Und er wird seinem Preis in keinster Weise gerecht. Aber immer mal langsam.Wie schon andere hier berichtet haben ist das Auspacken des Beoplay ein wahres Erlebnis. Man merkt definitiv dass man es hier mit einem Prestigeobjekt zu tun hat. Sowohl das Hardcase als auch der Kopfhörer bestehen aus Aluminium. Das gibt dem ganzen ein sehr hochwertiges Gefühl. Generell lässt sich an der Verarbeitung des Kopfhörers absolut nicht aussetzen.Tja, und damit wären wir schon am Ende der Liste mit den Positiven Dingen.Der Kopfhörer ist meiner Meinung nach sehr Unbequem. Er sitzt sehr eng auf den Ohren. Da hilft auch kein Lammleder. Klanglich ist er ebenso eine gewaltige Enttäuschung. Bei dem Preis erwartet man eine akustische Massage des Gehörgangs. Stattdessen erhält man keinen Bass, dafür aber extrem aufdringliche Höhen. Nach dem gefühlt 20gsten Versuch den Kopfhörer mit der dazugehörigen App zu koppeln hatte ich dann auch endlich Mal Erfolg. Leider kann man die App komplett vergessen. Ein Equalizer ist nicht vorhanden, stattdessen kann man aus verschiedenen Klangmodi wählen. Und kaum hab ich da was ausgewählt ist plötzlich nur noch Stöhnen und Krächzen zu hören. Auch zurückschalten hat das Problem nicht behoben.An dem Punkt hab ich den Kopfhörer wieder eingepackt und die Rücksendung veranlasst. ANC hab ich dann nicht mehr getestet.Für diesen Preis so einen Mist anzubieten sollte schon fast verboten werden. Der Kopfhörer sieht toll aus und an der Verarbeitung und Verpackung hat man definitiv nicht gespart, aber zu der Technik lässt sich bei aller Liebe nichts positives sagen. Schade.

I’ve been very impressed with my Beoplay H95 headphones, which I have been using for about 2 weeks. For context, I am a classical musician and record my own music. When researching BT ANC headphones, I sought out experiences by classical musicians, or people who listen to classical music, as the needs are different compared to other musical genres. Despite an extensive search I did not find much in this area so I am posting some of my experiences as they might be of interest to others.I use several different pairs of headphones, some for monitoring use in recording and editing, and others for sound checks and pleasure listening. It is unusual for any one headphone to serve all purposes! During recording, I generally use the tried and true and surprisingly inexpensive ubiquitous Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring. Most agree that these are very detailed and help reveal all the “warts” during the recording process, which is essential. However, I feel their sound signature is very bright and frankly unpleasantly harsh so they are not ideal for pleasure listening. I also use some excellent higher end headphones including the Sennheiser 800s, along with the companion Sennheiser headphone amp HDV 820, for critical and pleasure listening, as well as the Audeze LCD-X headphones which I use as a reality check during the recording process as well as for pleasure listening.With that context, enter the Beoplay H95. I purchased these for pleasure and convenience listening – as opposed to critical listening or recording - in a sometimes noisy home environment (lots of nearby heavy construction noise and leaf blowers nearly every day). I was seeking a pair of Bluetooth headphones with ANC that approached the higher fidelity of my other cans. After extensive reading of reviews of popular Bluetooth ANC headphones, for example Sony WH-1000XM4, Bose 700 and Apple Air Pods Max I decided to trial the Beoplay H95. Note that I did not audition these other lower cost headphones so I can’t realistically compare them to the Beoplay H95. However, I can compare the H95 to my higher end headphones and this may be of interest to some.Now, for additional important background, my use case is probably different than that of other headphone users. I don’t intend to use full size headphones walking about outdoors – I use Apple Airpod Pros for this. I also don’t intend to use full size headphones with ANC on commutes or on planes. Again, I would use the Airpod Pros or an older pair of Bose wired QC20 earbuds for this. So – my use case for a full size Bluetooth ANC headphone is for use indoors, freeing me from the cable tethering me to my good rig, listening for pleasure in a sometimes noisy environment. Other than ANC, sound quality is of paramount importance to me. Other features such as phone calls, apps, control gestures, voice control, are of secondary importance to me.I’ve found the Beoplay H95 sound signature to be very neutral and transparent. While clearly not as fine as higher end - and more expensive - cabled headphones, the sound quality that the H95 offers is quite respectable. The soundstage is fairly expansive, and while it may not be as wide or deep as the Sennheiser 800s (which is unusually vast) – the H95 soundstage is quite generous. This makes spatial location of different instruments, for example in an orchestra, better than in lesser headphones. The mid-upper frequencies are transparent and airy, and vocals, such as in classical art songs (e.g. lieder) sound very true and engaging. Instrumentals (piano, strings, orchestra) seem pretty accurate as well. Bass is tight and certainly present in sufficient quantity for classical music. It is not boosted or exaggerated as some might prefer for other genres of music. Recordings I’ve made of myself (i.e. me as performer) also seem pretty accurate. Of course, when I compare the H95 sound to my good rig, the difference is readily apparent – for example the Sennheiser 800s has a great deal more body, heft, clarity, liquidity, dynamic range and nuance where the H95 is a bit lighter weight, somewhat veiled, slightly grainy and compressed by comparison - but I feel overall the H95 does quite a very respectable job representing reality for a BT headphone.  Again, it is unreasonable to expect a BT ANC device to perform at the same level as much more expensive corded audiophile equipment. The H95 does come surprisingly close however!I have noticed what some others have called out, that to achieve decent listening volume, I need to dial the H95 up to >70% volume, which I feel is less than ideal and shouldn’t be necessary. For some softer classical tracks I need to dial it up to 90-100%. This suggests to me that there isn’t adequate headroom in the amplifier. The supplied USB-C to USB-A cable, intended for recharging the H95 battery, can also be used as a wired connection to a computer. In this case, the achievable volume is much improved compared to BT. I estimate that at 50% volume level in this wired setup is similar to 70-80% level in the BT configuration. A similar “boost” in volume occurs when using the supplied 3.5mm cable to the source, be it my iPhone 11 (with a lighting to USB cameras adapter), or PC. I believe the sound quality is also improved using the USB-A to USB-C cable, perhaps because the digital signal from the PC is bypassing the DA conversion in the H95. Another factor in the low volume output of the H95 via Bluetooth from my iPhone is EQ. Usually I have this set on “Classical” as that is the majority of my listening. However, I found that the EQ setting “None” (or “Flat” which seems equivalent) is still excellent sonically for my needs, and the volume is noticeably louder.I did have occasion to use the H95 in a phone call, and the sound was quite good at my end. At the other end, the sound quality was good enough for a hard of hearing elderly person to carry on a conversation better than when we use my land line.Regarding ANC – I agree with some other reviewers that while the dial on the left earpiece is handy for immediate control of ANC vs transparency, it would be nice to have a physical “stop” where it is obvious where the dial is minimized and where it is maximized. The dial spins freely so you have to judge based on your hearing to detect and set the desired amount of ANC. To be fair, they do offer audible tones instead of a physical stop, but you need to learn to “decode” the different tones. I found the ANC effective enough to minimize noise from construction next door through open windows, nearby washer/dryer noises, and even our land line ringing 3 feet away from where I’m seated was barely audible. Standing outside in my yard, a wood chipper being used 2 doors down was fairly noisy as one would expect. With the H95 on full ANC but without music playing, the wood chipper was about 80+% dampened, still somewhat audible. With music at low-moderate volume (~40-50%), the wood chipper was not apparent.Other Notes:- The dial on the right earpiece for volume is a brilliant feature in my opinion. Might be easier than APM's small knob. Incidentally, the small knob on the Apple Watch does control H95 volume when listening to Apple Music in an iPhone.- H95 has physical shut off switch, unlike APM, although the H95 has an ultra long battery life (38 hrs with ANC on and 50 hrs without ANC) making this less critical.- H95 has multipoint connection, allowing maintain connections to two Bluetooth sources, which means for example you can listen on one and make calls on the other- H95 has two corded options, both provided in the box: 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable (analog), and USB-C to USB-A (digital).- H95 has a real case, unlike APM. However, I feel it is useful mainly as a protective case at home, not practical for travel.- The Bang & Olufsen app is nice but not essential. I did not find the EQ options to be as useful as expected. I’ve settled on “Optimal” and have not found a need to change it. The variable option didn’t seem helpful or practical. The battery level indicator is useful to a degree, but due to the very long battery life, it doesn’t come into play much. On my PC Bluetooth section, the battery level is also indicated. The volume level can be adjusted on the H95 with the dial on the right earcup so the app is not needed for this. The app is a little glitchy on the iPhone – more than once even though it was paired (appears in Settings>Bluetooth and music plays through) the app sometimes paradoxically cannot detect the H95. I had to delete and reinstall the app more than once. There is no app for computers (just mobile devices) but sometimes the Bluetooth connection on my PC is glitchy with drop outs.SummaryWhile it is not fair to expect that Beoplay H95 would perform at the same level as corded audiophile headphones costing much more, I believe that B&O did right by most things that count to optimize fine sound quality. The only significant downside for me is the relatively lower volume level, requiring cranking up the volume >70%. Whatever this suggests about the amplifier design and relative lack of headroom, it is not a deal breaker in my mind. And even though the H95 is much more expensive than every other BT ANC headphone currently available, for me attaining this high level of sound quality was worthwhile. Of course, each person must make his/her own assessment and decision based on their sound goals and personal financial situation.

So i am kind of an Audiophile, own a bunch of gear including Audezes, Shures, Bose, B&Os and a couple of Amps and here is my ‘personal’ opinion and review based on my own Signature sound Profile. Everyone will have a different type of sound signature they like.Below are my Preferences and testing criteriaMusic: Deep house with cleaner bass , and Movie soundtracks (Hans Zimmer)Why did i need a new can?I was looking for something that can be portable, great sound quality. Great finish and interfaces, and BLUETOOTH with ANC!I tested the Focal Bathys, B&O HX and B&O H95Quality: The H95 wins this hands down. Both the Focals and HX felt cheap and plastic, and more disappointed on the Focals because its more expensive than any of the ones hereThe Metal and quality of H95 wins this. Great to touch and feel.ANC: i also have the Bose and if i compare the AnC with that, the bose wins. But compare the h95 to the other 2 here, H95 wins again.Sound quality: h95 has more base and punchy too, which is what i wanted for my deep house music. The focals did have more midrange, but not suitable for the kind of music i listen tooAccessories: again H95 wins. Love the metal box it comes it( though i will never use it) others were just cloth basedLooks: h95 looks sexy. Better than any of them.Portability: h95 is foldable and easy to carry. The others are notUsed Deezer and Spotify and Soundcloud to do the testing.For me, and the purpose i am looking to get- the H95 wins.Great product.

I YouTube'd for quite a while to determine the best wireless ANC headphones on the market.  The consensus among the high end headphones appears to be the H95.  After having them for a while, I'm going to have to go with a yes, they are very good.  The big advantage over the Apple Airpods max is they are noticeably lighter and seem more comfortable to wear.  Worth it?  For me, I guess the answer is yes.

I was very excited to use these as i've owned my Bose QC2 since 2019 and it was time for an upgrade. These headphones were the top of my list because... well.. B&O, who can resist this brand and it's quality? I mustered up about a grand for these beauties, but the excitement was short lived. I work from home and am constantly walking around from my bedroom office to kitchen, bathroom, etc. any time i would be further than 10 feet from my computer, the headphones would start distorting. i can overlook this, no big deal. my biggest hurdle was sound when i was simply walking with my phone on me, in a meeting. the sound would just disappear for several seconds at a time. i couldn't justify paying so much money for headphones that would drop connection like that as i've owned airpods, bose headphones and have never experienced it. i did research, tried to update firmware, etc., but nothing helped.sound is 11/10physical quality is 10/10connection is 7/10

I bought the Beoplay H95 for listening to music so that's what I will write about. I agree with many others that these sound better than most other wireless headsets currently available. There is always personal preference, but this set has solid performance that's hard to surpass. The sound is well rounded with sufficient depth and clarity and an appealing stage. Most people are particular about bass, and what this set delivers will appeal to accurate bass enthusiasts more than to those looking for bass boost. That said, there is plenty of bass for everyone.The app has an option to change the sound profile which made a pleasant difference to me as I like my sound more on the ""bright"" side. Likewise you can use this setting to make them sound as ""warm"" as your standard plastic phones. The H95 also support aptX which is an enhanced Bluetooth codec that made some difference on my Android phone.The noise cancellation on the H95 is not it's primary strength and not as good as on my Bose QC 35, but then again the sound is remarkably better. There seems to be some buzzing at whichever level you set it to, but it doesn't affect the listening experience. On the other hand, the transparency mode is a very useful feature, although these days fairly standard on noise cancelling phones. The controls make sense, less physical buttons and two integrated dials that are easy to operate.The H95 can be used as a wired headset, but to my surprise I didn't find a difference in sound quality between wireless and wired mode. Not sure what that says about either one. I did notice the low volume others have described, but it is definitely high enough for harm free listening and maybe that's what the makers intended. In any way, there is plenty of detail to make up for sheer volume. Battery life is so generous that I yet have to charge the set for the first time.In my opinion the H95 is a product with a purpose and the premium materials definitely help to set it apart. I would recommend it to anyone looking for cultivated listening, but the lingering question is whether it delivers what you expect for the price. At the end of the day, this set is in a class of its own.

From everything I've listened to these have the best sound quality of any wireless headphone - easily.  Makes my Sony XM4 headphones seem dark and noticeably lacking detail.  Previously Sony XM4s were at the top of most people's list for wireless cans.  Comfort-wise, the Sony's win (light weight and plus ear pads) but the B&O H95 are more luxurious and have a tighter seal.  ANC is similar - both top rate.Compared to my collection of wired headphones, the B&O H95 falls just below my lower tier audiophile headphones:  Sennheiser HD600 and HD650, HiFiMan Deva and Sony MDR-Z7M2.  And noticeably below my top-tier headphones Sony MDRZ1R, beyerdynamic T1 2nd Gen, HiFiMan HE6se and AKG K812 Pro.  I never expected this B&O H95 to challenge my best, but I wanted to see how close they would come.  Bluetooth just can't compete in a wired segment yet.The B&O H95 is very, very clear, has lots of detail, strong tight bass and textured highs.  I would consider it a mild to moderate V-shape which appears more pronounced because of the remarkable clarity they produce.  Sound stage is very good compared to my wired cans but the best I've heard in the Bluetooth arena.For portable listening I still prefer my wired in-ears: Sennheiser IE800 v2 and Westone W80 v2 and W60 v2.  Even with the larger drivers in the B&O H95, the clarity and quality of the Westone is better.  I actually consider my Westone W80 just a hair below my AKG K812 Pro and Sony MDR-Z1R (which are considered some of the best open and closed cans available right now).

I’ve been very impressed with my Beoplay H95 headphones, which I have been using for about 2 weeks. For context, I am a classical musician and record my own music. When researching BT ANC headphones, I sought out experiences by classical musicians, or people who listen to classical music, as the needs are different compared to other musical genres. Despite an extensive search I did not find much in this area so I am posting some of my experiences as they might be of interest to others.I use several different pairs of headphones, some for monitoring use in recording and editing, and others for sound checks and pleasure listening. It is unusual for any one headphone to serve all purposes! During recording, I generally use the tried and true and surprisingly inexpensive ubiquitous Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring. Most agree that these are very detailed and help reveal all the “warts” during the recording process, which is essential. However, I feel their sound signature is very bright and frankly unpleasantly harsh so they are not ideal for pleasure listening. I also use some excellent higher end headphones including the Sennheiser 800s, along with the companion Sennheiser headphone amp HDV 820, for critical and pleasure listening, as well as the Audeze LCD-X headphones which I use as a reality check during the recording process as well as for pleasure listening.With that context, enter the Beoplay H95. I purchased these for pleasure and convenience listening – as opposed to critical listening or recording - in a sometimes noisy home environment (lots of nearby heavy construction noise and leaf blowers nearly every day). I was seeking a pair of Bluetooth headphones with ANC that approached the higher fidelity of my other cans. After extensive reading of reviews of popular Bluetooth ANC headphones, for example Sony WH-1000XM4, Bose 700 and Apple Air Pods Max I decided to trial the Beoplay H95. Note that I did not audition these other lower cost headphones so I can’t realistically compare them to the Beoplay H95. However, I can compare the H95 to my higher end headphones and this may be of interest to some.Now, for additional important background, my use case is probably different than that of other headphone users. I don’t intend to use full size headphones walking about outdoors – I use Apple Airpod Pros for this. I also don’t intend to use full size headphones with ANC on commutes or on planes. Again, I would use the Airpod Pros or an older pair of Bose wired QC20 earbuds for this. So – my use case for a full size Bluetooth ANC headphone is for use indoors, freeing me from the cable tethering me to my good rig, listening for pleasure in a sometimes noisy environment. Other than ANC, sound quality is of paramount importance to me. Other features such as phone calls, apps, control gestures, voice control, are of secondary importance to me.I’ve found the Beoplay H95 sound signature to be very neutral and transparent. While clearly not as fine as higher end - and more expensive - cabled headphones, the sound quality that the H95 offers is quite respectable. The soundstage is fairly expansive, and while it may not be as wide or deep as the Sennheiser 800s (which is unusually vast) – the H95 soundstage is quite generous. This makes spatial location of different instruments, for example in an orchestra, better than in lesser headphones. The mid-upper frequencies are transparent and airy, and vocals, such as in classical art songs (e.g. lieder) sound very true and engaging. Instrumentals (piano, strings, orchestra) seem pretty accurate as well. Bass is tight and certainly present in sufficient quantity for classical music. It is not boosted or exaggerated as some might prefer for other genres of music. Recordings I’ve made of myself (i.e. me as performer) also seem pretty accurate. Of course, when I compare the H95 sound to my good rig, the difference is readily apparent – for example the Sennheiser 800s has a great deal more body, heft, clarity, liquidity, dynamic range and nuance where the H95 is a bit lighter weight, somewhat veiled, slightly grainy and compressed by comparison - but I feel overall the H95 does quite a very respectable job representing reality for a BT headphone.  Again, it is unreasonable to expect a BT ANC device to perform at the same level as much more expensive corded audiophile equipment. The H95 does come surprisingly close however!I have noticed what some others have called out, that to achieve decent listening volume, I need to dial the H95 up to >70% volume, which I feel is less than ideal and shouldn’t be necessary. For some softer classical tracks I need to dial it up to 90-100%. This suggests to me that there isn’t adequate headroom in the amplifier. The supplied USB-C to USB-A cable, intended for recharging the H95 battery, can also be used as a wired connection to a computer. In this case, the achievable volume is much improved compared to BT. I estimate that at 50% volume level in this wired setup is similar to 70-80% level in the BT configuration. A similar “boost” in volume occurs when using the supplied 3.5mm cable to the source, be it my iPhone 11 (with a lighting to USB cameras adapter), or PC. I believe the sound quality is also improved using the USB-A to USB-C cable, perhaps because the digital signal from the PC is bypassing the DA conversion in the H95. Another factor in the low volume output of the H95 via Bluetooth from my iPhone is EQ. Usually I have this set on “Classical” as that is the majority of my listening. However, I found that the EQ setting “None” (or “Flat” which seems equivalent) is still excellent sonically for my needs, and the volume is noticeably louder.I did have occasion to use the H95 in a phone call, and the sound was quite good at my end. At the other end, the sound quality was good enough for a hard of hearing elderly person to carry on a conversation better than when we use my land line.Regarding ANC – I agree with some other reviewers that while the dial on the left earpiece is handy for immediate control of ANC vs transparency, it would be nice to have a physical “stop” where it is obvious where the dial is minimized and where it is maximized. The dial spins freely so you have to judge based on your hearing to detect and set the desired amount of ANC. To be fair, they do offer audible tones instead of a physical stop, but you need to learn to “decode” the different tones. I found the ANC effective enough to minimize noise from construction next door through open windows, nearby washer/dryer noises, and even our land line ringing 3 feet away from where I’m seated was barely audible. Standing outside in my yard, a wood chipper being used 2 doors down was fairly noisy as one would expect. With the H95 on full ANC but without music playing, the wood chipper was about 80+% dampened, still somewhat audible. With music at low-moderate volume (~40-50%), the wood chipper was not apparent.Other Notes:- The dial on the right earpiece for volume is a brilliant feature in my opinion.

2022-04-18 MonI am:  Broadcaster  Musician  Acoustic Engineer  Loudspeaker Engineer  Recording EngineerHeadphone requires >2h burn in.  Before that headphone is terribly muddy....After two weeks:PROS+  Good isolation+  Good noise cancelling+  Great articulation relative to BlueTooth headphones, especially with bass, after some rolloff.+  Comfortable for >10h.+  5 Year Warranty+  Good BluetoothCONS– Not terrifically LOUD, barely sufficient in some cases.– Does not clamp head sufficiently for anything strenuous outdoors.– Bass Heavy, absolutely atrocious on this set. Complete tonal failure.  If you want accuracy, go to NeuMann NH20.  You are not going to find honesty with B&O.  BeyerDynamic Lagoon are a better alternative than B&O.RECOMMENDATION  Based on this review copy, these headphones are not worth the money at all with their gross deficiencies.  If you can stand to do the heavy EQ necessary, and love the two dial rings for volume & noise canceling, and money is not important, then ok. Otherwise, this headset is a royal pain.

Every audio company puts a priority on what matters to them the most in order to save cost. The B&O design and materials spared no expense, but the volume and clarity at high levels took a hit. I agree with other reviewers, the sound is very low and I had to listen at 70 percent to hit the music at enjoyable levels, however the vocals and other Mids took a hit.On the other hand, the XM5s look cheap and no where near pleasing to the eyes. However, they sound phenomenal over the H95s. If you want to flex on audiophiles or those in elites of society then they are for you. If you care about sound more, than I say get the XM5s.
"

I'm a headphone snob. I own several pairs and have used dozens throughout the years including all the popular models you may be familiar with. I use the Sony XM4s for my daily gym sessions along with the B&W PI7 buds. I think it's fair to say we've hit somewhat of a ceiling in audio quality in the last few years and it's very rare that I'm impressed or surprised by a new offering. The 95s... yeah. These baby's hit different. There's no sacrifice in audio quality under any circumstance. The low end is the most impressive aspect. Bass and sub bass on these completely blows away any other headphone I've used and it's not particularly close. It almost feels like a built in subwoofer, but unlike other bass heavy phones these never lose clarity and every detail is still present. There is no sloppiness in the low end. The mids are refined and excellent and the highs are crisp. Upon first listen you may not be blown away by the fidelity. It's when you go back and listen to other headphones that you will realize what you were missing. I was initially stuck trying to decide whether to purchase these or the Air Pods max (which I think are also excellent), for my daily at-home driver. While the APM have some advantages over the 95s the difference in sound quality was too great for my ears.

Comfort, looks, sound, ease of use, and any other factor that matters, you cannot do any better!This head set is just over the top classy, solidly the best.  Bang and Olufsen outdid themselves.

the sound quality is something indescribable, I thought I had good sound with other high end devices I own, I thought a bit to buy these for the cost, but I barely put it in my ears phew!  it is a balanced and powerful sound (it is something that I did not understand with the other devices) that had to increase more than 50% of the sound to hear the power, here I perceive it from the same volume, with a detail in instruments that I had not perceived before .  a sound worth its price.  I don't really care about the finishes and those details, in a few years I'll know if it's worth it and the planned obsolescence allows me to continue using it.the only half detail is the size of the headphones, maybe they could be a little bigger and my ears feel very fair, after three hours using them it doesn't bother me, but I have the impression that if the ears were freer the sound quality was better (with no desire to contradict the master engineers of B&O) remained married to his brand, may the successes continue.

I bought these for amazing sound and mic quality, I got what I wanted - here are other factors for others to consider.Pros:- Sound quality on an ANC Bluetooth Headphone doesn't get better, subjectively.- Build quality is large factor in price, feels luxurious, worth it.Cons:- Put in your AirPods, Bose, or Sony headphones, set volume to 80%, that's the max volume on these.- ANC isn't good, must set ANC/Transparency off in any sort of wind. Reminds me of 2013 Bose QCs.

I was fortunate enough to buy these at a discounted price.  I've owned a pair of H8s for years, and they're great--comfort, features, build and sound (good, punchy bass).  I was really expecting better with the H95s given the hype and price.  I was concerned when I read some reviews that indicated otherwise. Unfortunately, those reviews were true, especially of the sound quality.  The bass is not punchy and the sound is just above average.

I’ve owned the H9i for several years and been quite happy with them, so I was skeptical of the H95 at this price point. But after comparing the two side-by-side I’m keeping the H95 and selling the H9i. The H95 is an improvement in almost every category. The only negative I can find, versus the H9i, is the H95 are slightly heavier.Sound quality: Better. Overall clearer and I especially notice an improvement in the dynamics and transients.ANC: Much Better. This alone is worth the upgrade. The H9i’s ANC is just ok and narrows the soundstage significantly when enabled. The H95 corrects that flaw and has very little change in SQ even with ANC at max. You also control the H95’s ANC level and dial it to your liking. The H95’s ANC performance is also improved.Comfort/Looks: Equal. The H95 is heavier with a slightly more narrow, but also more plush, headband. Whereas the H9i has circular earcups, the H95 has oval/rectangular ones. I rate this a tossup for me and you’ll have to try for yourself. The lambskin earpads on both are amazing.Call quality/Transparency: Better. Hard to quantify, but the transparency mode sounds more clear and like the ANC you can dial the level to your liking.B&O listened to customer feedback and delivered an enhanced product. “Worth it” is subjective, but there’s no doubt they are an upgrade from the H9i.

If my wired ÆON 2 Noire through iFI-Audio xDSD Gryphon DAC is at 10, then:B&0 is at 8 (Unbelievable for Bluetooth noise cancelling)Apple Airpod Max would be at 5Sony XM5 would be at 3My ÆON is my final pick of comparing amazing wired headphones under 1.5K.They were Focals/Audeze/Shennherizer/Sony/(Re-SONY XM5)Listen to this B&O and it will make it clear where the Sony XM5 stands. I can't understand how people praise Sony XM5 for sound. Get the B&O if you value Sound Quality.Base is little raised in the B&O which I like. Comfort is perfect, weight perfect.

The sound quality and battery life are great. In my opinion the best looking headphone compared to competitors which is the reason I paid double for it. The ANC is rather disappointing and weaker compared to Bose headphones.

After using the Bang & Olufsen H9's for a couple years I decided to try the new H95s. First off, the packaging was great. They come in a nice box and its a great experience opening. The case the headphones come in is very solid and has a little compartment inside with a 3.5 mm cable and USB C cable. The headphones materials are top quality and I loved the metal turn dials. I miss the quick transparency mode gesture from the H9s though. Unfortunately they couldn't handle heavy bass. I listened to some Deftones and Run the Jewels and got distortion from the heavy bass hits. Everything else sounded great.. Maybe I got a defective pair but my H9's sounded much better, are lighter, and more comfortable. Headphones are very subjective and I'm sure they've worked fine for other people.

perhaps this is great for an audiophile, but not for me. the sound is so weird... there is so much detail and separation that the mixes are just falling apart. the music sounds so plain that doesn't evoke any emotions. I can't 'connect' to my favorite music

These are the best sounding wireless headphones I have ever heard and I've heard them all.  When wired they are true audiophile quality headphones.  They are very comfortable, high quality build and sound so much richer that the airpod max (which I had).  it's not even close.  The noise cancelling is great, just not as good as the Max.  Maybe equal to the Sony xm4 (which is still excellent).  For anyone who really appreciates the sound quality the 95 provides, they are worth the price.  I have apple music lossless paired with a dragonfly DAC, so I am getting true lossless sound and it is amazing.  They actually sound as good as my home system at 1/8th the price.  Wireless still gives you great sound with AAC used by apple music, much better than spotify.  I don't use Tidal due to it's limited  content.  All the contenders (Sony, Bose, Max, ect are excellent headphones and mostly worth the cost, but the H95 are in a league of their own.

If you value accurate sound reproduction, you will love these headphones. Others are lighter, but that’s because you need good physical drivers and magnets to reproduce sound correctly. Digital enhancement is great, but you cannot defy the laws of physics. Adjustable noise cancellation works really well, and transparency mode is very useful when traveling. High quality materials, great battery life. Haven’t worn them on a trans-Pacific flight yet, but I’m confident they will serve me well.

I personally like the way they sound in comparison to the airpods max. And you can actually turn them off a concept that apple could learn from. I have tested them with the pixel 6 pro which defaulted to APTX HD. And the iphone which uses AAC. They both sound great. IMO the bass is good but it does not drown out the vocals/instruments like some other headphones. They ANC does not cause ear pressure like the sony XM4's. Some reviewers say the H95's are not worth the price but I feel it was worth it. I may not be an audiophile but I do consider myself a headphone snob at the very least. They are very comfortable to wear though I do not wear glasses. The build quality might be better on the airpods max but it also makes them more heavy. I think these are the best headphones you can get for having both wireless and ANC.

I wanted to love these headphones and if I didn't need Noise Cancellation I would give them 5 Stars. They are extremely well designed and built. The controls are B&O simplicity. I compared the Active Noise Cancellation of the Beoplay H95's to a pair of five year old Bose headphones my spouse uses. Even at the maximum ANC setting on the Beoplay H95's, there was noise present and not being cancelled. Music played at medium volume would drown out the noise however during quieter passages the noise was heard. The Bose did a good job cancelling the same noise. Since the return period will expire before I could test them on a flight, I am returning them and have ordered the new Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones.

After trying Sennheiser, audeze, hifiman, Sony, bowers and Wilkins, klipsch, and other brands I can’t remember, these finally hit the spot.

I will keep them only because they are more comfortable than my $350 Bose 700 around my neck when I am not listening to music.  The audio quality is much better with these, high, low, and mid. If you are an audiophile, these blow my Bose and Sennheisers away. The volume is lacking, you won't be able to get it up to what I consider what most people would like, it will be kind of quiet to retail quality of sound. The comfort of the hardware however is great, same goes for noise cancelling (though not as good as the Bose). I like the tactile dials, but it is not as good as the Bose. All in all I would say you can save some money going for the Bose. If money is not an option, these are a lot more comfy, which is why I am keeping them.

I like the dynamic running through my ears, the sound is so realistic and the H95 sounds better than any other headphones. And I like the service that Amazon and Bang&Olufsen provided. It's the most perfect purchasing experience that I've ever had in my life. Thanks for Amazon and Bang&Olufsen.

Sound signature is one of its kind, but the noise cancellation is really poor. I couldn’t wear it in a flight and not comparable to the noise cancellation of Bose and Apple headsets. Even the comfort is really bad, I couldn’t wear it for longer listening times. But I have to give a 5 start for the sound signature, its inline any other headphones.

Please refer also to my review of B&O HX and Sennheiser Momentum 4 because I tested all three just about at the same time. In short I couldn't find a single reason not only to justify it's price but just to keep them regardless of it.This is very harsh, I understand but it is what it is. Just try them, I doubt their excessive weight and clamping force and less than ideal pads shape will win you. Give it a couple of minutes and you will find your self already thinking you want these things off. The unrefined sound will not help to get you to forget about the discomfort as well as the disappointingly low sound level they can reach.I love B&O but the H95 are totally unworthy. Returned. HX is a much better value for the money.

Honestly, if I am buying a almost 900 dollar headphone it better sound like a 900 dollar headphone , it should blow me away and I would be like , “what just happened here ? Are the gods whispering to me ?”That did not happen !I bought a AirPod Max as well to compare and yes I feel these are better but just slightly.The build quality is good not not great , I was expecting a lot more for a 900 dollar headphone.You can get a lot of videos about sound quality and unboxing and stuff in YouTube so not going to waste time about that here. At the end of the day it needs to “wow” YOU not anyone else. It should put a smile on your face after a hard days work, that did not happen for me.And gosh , made in China , really for 900 ? That kinda curbed my enthusiasm a little bit.

When using this product keep in mind that when taking calls or using a communication app like discord it changes to a crappy audio output instead of staying at stereo which is a shame. I wish I could disable that and enable the mic without the poor quality audio output. Battery is absolutely great.

I am 6ft man. My head is not considered a huge head however it is proportional to my height and build. At the maximum setting the upper part was pushing so tightly downwards giving me an instant headache. B&O clientele are tall people! Not sure why their headphones was built for a kids size head

Sound is great,  but at this price point I expect the headphones to pair — and remain paired — seamlessly to my iPhone and/or iPad.  Worked ok up until the latest B&O software update (April 2021).  Now, no matter how many times I go through the instructions, while the H95 will pair to my devices, it drops within 20 seconds or so.  It then randomly pairs on/off, but will not remain paired, rendering these headphones useless for work or play.  Exact same behavior whether iPhone or iPad.  Unacceptable.  Way beyond return window, so now all i can do is use a hardwire connection and wait til B&O provides yet another software download…fingers crossed.

I have several pairs of headphones including 10+ pairs of Bang & Olufsen headphones among other brands. The sound from these headphones is the most pure and amazing I've ever experienced. Was sad because I'd just received a pair of HXs 2-3 weeks prior. Although the HXs were awesome compared to the H9 gen 3s, they were nothing compared to the H95s.I get they're pricy. However, if you can do it, do it. They are absolutely phenomenal.Ok. Updated review. The headphones are definiteIy worth five stars. The company? One star and only because I have to provide them with at least one star. I had a defective pair. Sent them back for service. After over two weeks of sitting on the headphones along with ridiculous and nonsensical interactions, B&O informs me the headphones are no longer available in black. No longer available. So now they are trying to force me to pick a color I do not want. Not sure how this is going to end, but at this point, it ain't pretty.

I bought these headphones about 2 years ago.They’re the best I’ve ever had. Easy connectivity, great app management, beautiful, strong ANC. Oh, and they sound way better than anything else with great battery life.My only complaint is the carrying case. It’s enormous. The point of folding cans is portability. The aluminum case is great in that it offers protection for very expensive headphones but it takes up too much space in the backpack, both in footprint and in thickness. If there was a smaller aluminum case I would buy it in a heartbeat.

These are the best made and best sounding Bluetooth headphones you can buy. As other reviewers have pointed out the sound out of these, for Bluetooth, is just not right. It just shouldn’t be this good.These are for people who appreciate that extra refinement in sound quality with the build quality too.Soundstage is great for closed back wireless. Better than some open back cans.Imaging and instrument separation is great.Bass is solid and refined.Overall sound signature is refined, balanced, and just pleasant in the best way.ANC is good but not great. Transparency mode is good but not great. Both are very functional but not Apple, Bose or Sony level.Mics are very good. I have used these for hours on Teams calls and colleagues say I sound clear and great.Battery is great.These will not replace my HifiMan Ananda but, for me, when I’m working and my kids come home from school or I’m back traveling they allow me to get as close as I can to my desktop system. That, for me, makes this worth the money.Not for everyone but the right use cases. Enjoy!!

There is just something in the air when you hold something that feels so premium. Once you open the package and see the metallic carrying box and pull out the headphones you will feel the rush of satisfaction. Premium leather headbands with metal casing, the fit and finish is fantastic. The dials on both earcups are meticulously finished and do not feel wobbly like some others tend to be that uses dials for controls.Once you put them on your head, you will feel comfortableness. If even that's a word. The removable earpads feels like clouds against your flesh. And all of this without being too heavy. I was afraid it would keep sliding off my head due to the heft, but not at all. It's by no means flimsy light, but theres a good balance to it. Even the included charging cable and airplane jack screams of premium quality.Now onto the function. Sounds great, not the best for these over ear category headphones that I've tried in the pas, including Bose and Sony, but has great lows and crisp highs. The app allows some very shallow editing of the EQ. The ANC is ok, not up to the heavyweights but passable. On the other hand, the Ambient pass-through is pretty weak and does change up the sounds of the content you're playing. Sounds robotic. I would say mid-level at best.The bass is nice and rumbly without distorting, but the volume is a tad bit low for my liking, so bassheads probably need to go elsewhere. Like most audiophile type equipment, the sounds are geared towards balanced and clean.Battery life is fantastic, worn them for a few hours a day for over 2 weeks and still about 35% left. The app is polished and clean (vs the cluttered look of Sony's), although a bit lacking in functionality.Now does the premium construction and above average sound output worth over $800 to you? If you want to be different, yes, but if not, then I would stick with the consumer heavyweights out there, mainly Sony and Bose. Beats not need apply.

I'm not an audiophile, but I LOVE having a good collection of random headphones and earbuds so I can stay connected. I've got Galaxy Buds, Bose QC Earbuds, Beats Solo Pro 3, etc., so, I've had a lot of different products to get used to and really put through the ringer. Which is why it's taken a bit of time for this review to come out: I've put these things through the proverbial ringer.First and foremost, these things LOOK incredible. Though it's a shame that the blue plastic feels off the top of the earphones (as it looked eye popping, slick, and happens to be one of my favorite shades of blue), it doesn't do anything to take away from the overall elegance of the product. The presentation is spectacular: a heavy metal case, a hard cloth interior (with special compartment for aux chord, charger, etc), and a slot built so the headphones have a nice snug (but not too snug) place to fall right into.Second, the comfort. These things feel super light while on your head, and the noise cancellation is immediate, as the cups do truly seal off the outside noise. When you try to remove them from your ears, you can feel a slight, almost imperceptible, tug (in NO way uncomfortable), as it's almost as if they are magnetically attached and you're just breaking that magnetic seal. It's so minor but so important, because it proves that these things are serious about noise cancellation.Third, the sound. I used a recent album to really test out the quality of these. I listen to rock and metal mostly, so I listened to Chevelle's new album NIRATIAS. I'd listened to this album at least a dozen times before I got these and from the first few seconds, I noticed an immediate difference. The basslines of the first song were rumbling like a freight train and never went away. Now, I noticed the bass before, but this took it to a whole different level, and that's what I found on the rest of the music I listened to: the clarity is incredible. These make those Beats Solo Pro 3 sound like dollar store earbuds from 2010, and I like those Beats too.Finally, the battery. I received them at 50% a couple weeks ago, and after numerous hours of listening at work on and off, they are now down to 25%. Incredible.The price tag is high, but if you really want some quality headphones and can afford them, it's hard to tell you not to here. They are, quite simply, THE best I've ever used.

The quality of b & O has suffered over the years.I purchased my first B & O Beogram in 1976 and it is still woking as well as the day I bought it.

Update: Sept 7 2021. The B&O 95 continue to be amazing. I've had these on my head every day since they  arrived. These are silky smooth. The ios app sucks and it can never find the headphones, but I mainly use these with my PC anyway. The sound though. SO GOOD! I do have a complaint and that's the head band. This thing bites into the top of my head and I have to take them off after an hour or so and take a break. These need better and more padding.--Original review: I have an entire wall of headphones because - reasons. Recently I've been loving the Sony in ear wf-1000xm4 and my beloved Sennheiser HD650s are always in arms reach at my desk. Since the Bang and Olufsen H95's arrived, I haven't listed to another headphone.These are LUSH. The sound manages to come at you in a wide sound field that encompasses my ears. The drivers in this headphone are flat out amazing. They are mostly neutral, but they also have a distinct V shape, which I personally love. The sub bass is sublime and rolls off effortlessly into mids. The treble sparkles and even though there is a bare hint of sibilance I forget about it.The H95s are built like a tank and even though I haven't tried Apple's new high end headphones, they would have to be seriously amazing to compete with the Beoplays. The ear cups are made of lambskin and they are, like the headphone sound, lush.To match the price, these arrive in a seriously impressive case that has the cables inside under a flap. The headphones fold up and fit perfectly. I've been leaving them out on top of the case because the headphones look that nice.Noise cancellation is top-notch and it handily challenges Sony and Bose. The nobs built into each speaker control noise cancelling on the left, while the right nob rolls the volume up or down. I don't use these for phone calls or for the voice assistant (I don't use that on any headphone) so I can't speak to their abilities.I've never had a pair of wireless headphones that did it all like the H95s, and I suspect I'm going to be listening to these for many years to come. These are absolutely worth every penny.

These are very pricey for what you get -- so if cost isn't an issue these might be great headphones for you -- they do have a few limitations though.A few things I've noticed (I've used quite a few headphones, but mostly the Bose QC35's).* Bluetooth range, significantly better than the Bose, I can get most of my house with these, and left them on once by accident and they connected out in the yard even.* Comfort.  They feel a bit heavier than the Bose QC35's, and I think they are, but they are still quite comfortable -- just as much as the Bose -- which has been my biggest drawback getting headphones, all day comfort.  I can wear these all day without issue.* Sound -- These have a really nice sound, deep bass, music punches through, one of the highlights.* Dials/Switches - These are ok, I wish they had a play/pause button, but the headphone volume is nice, and the noise cancellation level is nice.* Noise Cancellation -- reviews say this is just ok, but I think it's quite a bit better than the Bose -- so a step up there, but haven't tried the Sony's XM4's which are supposed to be much better now.Now some of the low lights:* Wish they had an automatic sensor when you took them off to pause your music.  I feel at this price point they should.* The tap to pause on the ear cup is super annoying -- it doesn't always work, and when it does it's slow.* Pass thru audio -- I wish there was a button to press to turn on mics to quickly hear someone.* Price -- you already know this, but it's priced double what competitors are -- and I think you get a step up on sound quality, but you're also unfortunately missing a few features -- so not sure I can recommend at this price.

There is no denying that B&O is all about luxury, unique design language, and quality. With the H95, B&O is celebrating its 95 years in the audio industry, which places a rather high bar on expectations.Upon opening the packaging, the level of care taken is immediately apparent. In the box, you are met with a hard aluminum case with the B&O branding. While great-looking and obviously highly protective, it makes it less portable, especially when carrying it in a backpack. Included are a soft cleaning cloth, an airline audio adapter, a braided 3.5mm, and a USB-C to USB-A power cord. These are high-quality accessories as expected. It might not be important, but I loved the brand-new smell coming from the case.The H95 headset itself is certainly a piece of art. The light grey and aluminum design scream premium aesthetics, and the build quality is unquestionable. I appreciate that there is no stitching on the headband this time and is quite flexible. The aluminum arms are easily adjustable but still retain a good level of rigidity and are totally foldable. The swirl-brushed aluminum sides pleasantly reflect light. Breaking away from the traditional B&O round cup design, the (thankfully) removable earpads have an oval shape and are made of lambskin, which in my experience, gets better with use (I still own and use the original wired H6). If there is anything to nitpick, is that they may be susceptible to getting dirty quickly.The H95 features a combination of touch and physical controls. Typically, this can be confusing but I think B&O has a good balance here. Power, pairing, and the voice assistant are assigned to buttons. While B&O is not the first to do it, the volume and ANC levels are controlled by a rotatory dial on either cup and feel intuitive in my opinion. Play, pause, and call answer/reject are controlled by tapping the right cup, which feels natural. Controlling tracks works by swiping back and forth and works faultlessly.I found the H95 very comfortable. The headband padding is enough to ease head soreness and the incredibly soft lambskin feels like pillows on my ears -even when wearing glasses. There is good depth in the ear cup, which allows my entire ear inside. I did notice a bit of clamping force, especially on the upper jawline, but went away soon. Although they are a bit heavy, I was able to wear them for about 3 hours at a time (I do not like to keep headphones on for too long) without fatigue.The battery life is impressive. B&O claims up to 38 hours of playback with ANC on and a whooping 50 without. Since I got them over a week ago, I have not charged them once, which should take about 3 hours.Featuring Bluetooth 5.1, the H95 is future-proof. Pairing is super easy with the “Google Fast Pair”, iOS pairing, and “MS Swift Pair”. They also support SBC, AAC, and aptX Adaptive so I was not able to pick up any lag when watching videos or playing games. I was able to maintain a good connection at decent distances while walking around my medium size apartment. I am very pleased that this headset has a multipoint function, as I was able to go from my iPad to my phone seamlessly with no hiccups.Most importantly (to me at least) is the sound quality. Sure, the sound signature is subjective, but I am happy to say that the H95’s 40mm drivers do not disappoint. The bass response is well defined, punctual, but still felt. There’s restrained sub-bass that adds body without getting muddy. The midrange takes center stage as vocals, rhythm instruments, and dialog comes in clearly. The treble soars without being harsh or fatiguing. There was no noticeable sibilance. The 20-22000Hz frequency response allows for sounds to come through that usually fade in other headsets. The soundstage and channel separation are also impressive. I was able to pinpoint where the sound is coming from and even depth, giving the impression that I was in a large open space. I must say that it is quite the experience no matter the music genre or content, as I found myself looking for nuances and detail that I might have missed before, especially with lossless/HD sources.The adaptive Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes work very well. With a neutral ANC setting, I was able to drown an annoying neighbor’s lawnmowing to the point where I had to pause the music to see if he was done. Switching between ANC and transparency modes, and adjusting levels is as easy as rotating the left dial (nice!)Just in case you are not fully satisfied with the sound, it can be further customized with the B&O app. Speaking of the app, you can adjust the ANC, update firmware, and other settings. It is not as robust as I would have liked but gives enough options to make it a worthwhile companion.So, is the H95 worth the higher-than-premium price tag? For the casual listener that is looking for something more affordable with similar features, perhaps not. For the person that wants exceptional build quality, jam-packed features, intuitive controls, functionality, and a Hi-Fi sound signature -all within the unique and luxurious B&O design, absolutely!

Bang and Olufsen are world renown for making superb audio products with prices that will make your head spin and your bank account go into the red. However that being said, these headphones are pure bliss and an exquisite listening pleasure. The sound is impeccable and the fit is comfortable. A word of caution, these are not casual headphones. I mean, I wouldn't take these on a bike ride or a visit to the gym. The case they came in is superb as well guaranteeing that they will be safe and secure and will provide countless hours of listening pleasure.

The best of the best, the best sounding, best looking, top notch quality headphones on the market.  Sound quality is as close to perfect as I have ever experienced, no matter how loud or quietly I listen to music.  It is immediately obvious that the highest quality materials went into building these headphones.  From the beautiful aluminum storage case that these headphones come in, to the lamb skin leather, these headphones are well worth the price.  Bang & Olufsen H95 headphones are the epitome of amazing sound quality combined with luxury and build quality.

These are really nice headphones but it's simply way overpriced.The sound is good but nothing that will blow your mind and I have bluetooth headphones that have just as good and better sound at less than 1/3 of the price.The materials use is without a doubt really nice and the build quality is top notch.  No complaints here at all.Zero issues with quality.  These are built very solid.My problem is the price.At this price everything about this should blow me away but it simply doesn't.I feel like these should be about half the price they are now.Price aside, everything works good and the sound is nice and balanced.For me it's got just the right amount of bass.  Not too much and not too little.If you are a basshead however,  I think you will be disappointed with these.  The bass is in no way missing or lacking but it doesn't have the head thumping bass that a basshead would be looking for.It has a well balanced sound but nothing that blows me a way.  And at this price, it should.These headphones are a bit heavier than most bluetooth headphones but are still comfortable to wear for hours without any hotspots for me.I like the hardcase it comes with but it's a fingerprint magnet.  I wish they would have used a different coating that wasn't such a fingerprint magnet.Ultimately, these are really nice bluetooth headphones but at this price, everything about it should be perfect and blow me away but it simply doesn't.

To commemorate 95 years of business in the audio industry, Bang & Olufsen released the Beoplay H95 in 2020.These headphones combine cutting edge tech, with excellent materials; to create a product that looks, feels, and sounds great!The Lambskin Leather Earpads have a rich smell which I personally enjoy, but may not be suitable for everyone. The smell is not artificial at all, and has continued to last, even though I've worn them for many hours.The earpads are magnitized to the headphone, which is a nice touch. This makes an upgrade very simple when it's time to replace them.These headphones are powered by a 1200 MAH battery. I have easily gotten the 38 hour battery life with ANC active, with volume at low to medium levels. Without ANC you can expect 50 hours of battery life, and it takes 3 hours to recharge the headphones from 0-100%.While there is no quick charge information available for the headphones, consider that if the headphones can last for 50 hours in passive mode, then 15 minutes of charging could provide approxamately 4 hours and 17 minutes of playback. not to shabby.The Active Noise canceling is top notch, and you can dial in your preference to get the right amount of noise cancelation you prefer. There are quiet beeps which are heard once you hit the maximum ANC level. There are 2 dials on the headphone, one on each earcup. The left dial, when turned backward, activates ANC. Turn it forward, and the noise from the world around you is quietly introduced.There are also beeps to indicate once you've dialed the ambient mode to it's max setting.The ambient noise sounds very natural when piped in to the headphones. I was able to enjoy music and talk with my Brother while lying in a massage chair, and had no trouble hearing him or the music.The Dials are subtlely placed on the headphone so they aren't easily bumped unintentionally.The left earcup also has a button to activate your phone's assistant.The right earcup contains the power switch, hold this switch after powering on the headphones to enter pairing mode.There are touch controls on the right earcup for play-pause and track navigation. Every control feels natural and intuitive.press once to play or pause, twice to move to the next track, 3 times to move to the previous track. press once to answer and end calls, press and hold to reject calls.The volume dial is on the right earcup. Turn forward to raise, and backward to lower.The Headphones are also capable of multipoint, which means they can connect to 2 devices at once.call quality was good with these.No one complained: or asked if I were on speaker phone, Bluetooth, ETC. Most background noises were not picked up while I talked.The headband is very flexible but not flimsy. It can be adjusted, and provides great support.Maximum comfort is easily achieved thanks to the easy adjustment of the headphones. While I do prefer click by click adjustments on the headphone arm, it is easy to identify the best fit. The earcups move smoothly up and down the aluminum rails, and easily stay in place once you've found your prefered fit.the case feels very premium and closes via a magnet. Inside are the Headphones, a 3.5 MM Audio cable, USB-C charging cable, Airline Adapter, product literature and Cleaning cloth.Bang & Olufsen stands behind the Beoplay h95 with a best in class, 3 year Warranty.Noise canceling is quite effective.low rumbling noises are reduced or illiminated to a significant degree. Fan noise is also greatly reduced, and voices are as well. With music at low to medium volumes I was able to completely focus on what was coming from the headphones. This was also true for podcasts and audio books. I haven't flown with these yet, but I have taken a noisy Commuter train a few times and wearing these has been a treat.The H95 support SBC, AAC, and APTX adaptive bluetooth Codecs. For Android phones that don't have APTX Adaptive, the H95 will connect via standard APTX, AAC, or SBC.There was no delay between audio and video connected via APTX Adaptive while paired to my LG V60. I can walk through my apartment with no issues, and a multi story home, in both cases leaving my phone on a desk while I walked around.The Beoplay app, available for both IOS and Android, allows for customizing the sound via eq presets.I almost always mess with the sound of any headphone I use, even though I enjoy many different sounds and tunings. With the H95 however, i haven't played with the sound presets once. I quite enjoy the default tuning.One trait I've observed in Headphones from B&O is the feel of a bass drum or kick drum. It feels genuine and almost speaker like. meaning to my ears, it has the feel and sound of what I hear in full range speakers.it has a satisfying affect on the rest of the mix.Aside from this, Bass feels very lively and controled on the H95.There is great texture and level of bass all throughout the lower frequencies.Occasionally there have been situations where I would like just a hair more definition accross the midrange, to give the headphones a bit more energy to guitars, but more to Brass instruments, then some Woodwind instruments, in that exact order. But this thought is not constant, and I only want this in certain situations.As is, the mids are pretty even in and don't randomly spike or feel harsh or sharp.Treble is very pleasant with this tuning. Sure some things could sound a bit more realistic, like crash symbols, but generally speaking, this is a well tuned, refined sound signature that does well with whatever you throw at it.Bang & Olufsen emphasize that every detail is important.Whether it's the high quality braided cables, the straps that hold them together, the clean design of the case, the ridges of the aluminum dials, the smell of the earpads, the natural sound of Ambient mode, the emphasis on canceling out a wide swath of noise, or the premium tuning of the Audio drivers, nothing about these headphones was ignored or implemented without the big picture in mind.When you buy the Beoplay H95, you get a Headphone that combines the best in technology today, with the timeless craftsmanship Bang & olufsen has used from day one.

 Attaching a video that shows a fault in the noise cancelling that causes the headphones to emit a high-pitched, loud noise. This happened with two sets (B&O replaced my first one). Then they claimed this was “by design” and that the workaround was to turn off the ANC feature.They also confirmed this was the same mechanism used in all their headphones. Their words:“the active noise cancellation feature, which can be turned off via the steps here, has no design flaw as the iteration used in the H9 3rd Generation was also used in other headphone models with no issues reported on them either.”

I just received the H95 and I have owned the APM for around 6 months now. Before the APM, I owned the Sony WH-1000XM3 for several years and this was primarily used for my frequent business trips to Asia as well as within the US. For this purpose, the Sony was just fine - kill the noise during the flights - but the sound wasn't up to snuff considering that I'm an audiophile with headphones like the Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC and RAAL SR1a being driven by Chord TT2 DAC, Mscaler and TToby amp as well using Audeze LCDi4 and a custom JH Audio Layla IEM for mobile. So, I'm one of those crazy audiophiles (although I decided enough is enough and that I've reached my endgame for that kind of stuff) and decided that I need to really upgrade my collection of mobile true wireless ANC headphones and earphones.Compared to the Sony XM3, the APM was definitely a big upgrade in almost every way - especially the sound but in usability as well. For me, the comfort wasn't quite as good as I expected and it has moisture condensation issue in the ear cups that become bothersome after an hour or two so that has started frustrating me. That's when I started looking at alternatives. I've been through the Sony and Bose QC route over the years and wanted to move on from those although they are fine for what they are in their price points. So I looked at the pricier options from the likes of M&D, B&W, and Mont Blanc before deciding the APM made the most sense. The ANC is great and the sound is very good but I just couldn't seem to bond with it. I liked it but I didn't love it.Enter the B&O H95 on my radar. At first, I rolled my eyes at the price but, heck, the Abyss headphone with its TOTL cable is almost 10x the price of this and needs another $17K worth of DAC, amp and cables so it could very well be a ""bargain"" in comparison. Plus, I can take it on my business trips and RV/camping excursions as well as use it at the office (at work and at home) without being tethered by a cable while enjoying pretty decent sound quality. That was my hope and plan and, I have to say, it has worked out exactly to my expectations. The H95 is great and addresses all of the shortcomings - however small - of the APM.The build quality is excellent as expected and has all the necessary features and I do like the dials to adjust the volume and the ANC level although the small dial on the APM is fine as well. Most of the time, I have the ANC set to the max and that's fine. I think the ANC on the H95 is excellent and very comparable to that of the APM and the Sony XM3. Comfort is definitely better on this for me than the APM. Not sure what it is about the APM but it just doesn't seem to conform to my head as well as the H95. I'll need more time with the H95 to reach a verdict but, after a few hours, it still feels good and I don't have the annoying condensation I've been experiencing with the APM.Sound-wise, which is the most important factor, the H95 isn't going to compare to TOTL ""summit-fi"" headphones from the likes of Abyss, RAAL, Hifiman, and Audeze that I own or have owned in the past but this is just in a different category and price point. That being said, I'm quite impressed with the overall sound quality of the H95. Even coming from that absurd segment of the audiophile world, I can say that I'd be happy with the sound quality of the H95 for most of the day and relegate the expensive stuff to occasional serious listening sessions when I'm willing to be chained with cumbersome cables to a morass of boxes connected by a spaghetti mess of more cables.The H95's sound is very clear, balanced, neutral, and spacious with a deep but unobtrusive bass. The soundstage is by far the best I've heard on an ANC wireless headphone and the imaging is also excellent with nice separation between the various instruments. The midrange is full-bodied and very natural sounding. The treble has just the right amount of shimmer and never gets grating, no matter what kind of genre I play. I mainly listen to classical, jazz, acoustic and ambient electronic although I will sometimes dig out my old rock, metal, and pop kinds of stuff. I prefer a very balanced sound without any specific bands of frequencies being emphasized and the H95's sound signature delivers exactly that.I still plan to keep the APM and I'm sure my wife will use it more often than I do now. I guess it's basically hers now. Overall, for me, the H95 is just so much better - especially in regards to the sound but also in comfort - than the APM. To me, the sound of the H95 is easily superior although the APM is no slouch and is certainly much, much better sounding than the Sony XM3 which I've now passed onto one of my sons. My wife and my sons get my leftovers. Haha.In conclusion, the H95 is everything I expected it to be and, for me, it's definitely worth every penny. It seems that it will still be some while before I can go on my quarterly 2~3 week business trips to Asia visiting suppliers and customers or even within the US with this unending pandemic situation but the H95 will be great at home and in the office as well. Very pleased with the H95 and I highly recommend it to the audiophile types who want to get the best possible ANC wireless headphone. This being said, I fully understand that $850 can seem kind of ridiculous when there are very good options like the APM, XM4, Bose 700 and other great brands like Bowers & Wilkins and Master & Dynamic. If you can allocate the budget, do go for it. It isn't perfect but it pretty much checks all the boxes.

I have many audiophile grade headphones, which are all excellent in their own right, but let me tell you these headphones are nothing short of stellar. The sound that comes out of these 40mm drivers shouldn't even be possible! Do they have the head rattling bass? No, but the bass they reproduce is so tight and precise that the whole audio band is elevated and not muddied in the slightest. Also, holy sound stage and imaging! They are also stunning to look at and feel like two little clouds when placed on your head. Not that my wallet would want it, but I would gladly pay $1000 for this masterpiece!

I auditioned Momentum 3's, Shure Aonic 50's & Apple Pro Max's. I also have two pairs of Momentum 2's that are both near or at the end of their lifespan. Of them all, past and present, the B&O H95's are subjectively the best BT headphones I've ever heard. It's odd b/c I didn't like the way they sounded out of box. They sounded average at best. A week later and it looks like I'm going to keep them. I'm guessing the increase in sound quality is due to burn in or brain in. Anyway, one of three concerns is the EU limiter, as the volume is extremely low. The second are the ear-cups, they’re shallow and don’t completely envelop my ears. The last is price. Do I really want to spend this much for a pair of BT headphones. Only time will tell, but it looks like I'm going to keep them.16 Jan 2022: The EU volume limiter proved to be too much for my ears. Speaking of which, the ear cushions proved to be way too stingy as well. Return label requested.

Those are the the best headphones I ever had, sound is just fantastic without even touching EQ, this is a masterpiece, they are expensive but worth the price, Im not sure but I think you wont find better headphones. I had those headphones for test: Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX, Bowers & Wilkins Px7, SENNHEISER Momentum 3, Master & Dynamic MW65, Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro but H95 are the King of the universe :). They are a little smaller than B&O HX which I don't like. I have big head and they are tight on my head, HX are more comfortable but sound quality is more important for me so I chose H95. I love them.

I bought these because I travel alot and needed some nice new headphones and I've always had great experience with other B&O products. Honestly these headphones are by far the best I've ever weilded or used. High attention to detail. The hinges and sliders all feel very solid and high quality. The ear muffs easily come off to be replaced. Amazing sound quality. Crisp and clear and the bass isn't overbearing like I was worried it might have that vibration behind it you can hear in alot of other headphones. Just the right of amount of bass to feel hitting the way you want from a pair of headphones. After about a week of use both for calls, travel, music, and gaming. The only two things I noticed is I have not been able to get them to connect to the B&O application to adjust any of the headset settings. Stock is amazing as is. But hopefully they fix this in an update.

These are by far the most expensive set of ANC headphones I have.  Sound quality is great for a pair of wireless headphones, but nowhere near a similar priced wired headphones.  These do sound really good, open soundstage with very clear high, mids and lows.ANC function is just a gimmick, I think most of the headphones are about the same.  But unlike the B&W PX7, these won’t give me a headache while using the ANC function.These are made with very high quality materials and the penalty for that is weight.  You’ll feel every bit of it during long listening sessions.  Padding on the ear cups are very soft and comfortable, but they are on the small side.  It is small in size and shallow in depth, bigger ears will touch the edges of the ear cup and the drivers.Battery life is great so far.  It had been out performing the advertised numbers.Overall I am very happy with the product, these are my go to headphones for short trips and casual listenings.

I have been searching for a pair of high quality ANC headphones with apt-x low latency codex built in so I can use them to watch my TV via a FireStick and or Apple TV without any audio lip sync delays for a while now and I have finally found the only pair that can give me what I have always wanted with awesome ANC to boot! These are hands down the best sounding and best ANC headphones I’ve ever used and I own the Sony XM4’s and the Bose NC700’s (FYI neither Sony or Bose have low latency codex’s so they are unusable for TV viewing since the lip sync is HORRID).My first attempt at having some higher end headphones was with the Air(Pod Max’s (aka APM’s). I just went through three (3), yes three, different sets of the APM’s and each of the three failed within 25 days of everyday normal use. The failure seems to be linked to the moisture buildup in the ear cups that eventually causes the transparency button to short causing the transparency mode to switch on, off, on, off, on, off over and over and over constantly. No amount of factory resets or soft resets would fix the problem and even after getting AppleCare+ and getting a replacement pair those too failed. So far Apple refuses to acknowledge this major design flaw so when you use up all your replacements with AppleCare+ you’re on the hook to pay out of pocket for repairs which can really start to add up.Anyway, after going through 4 months of the APM failed experiment I came across these BeoPlay H95’s and was intrigued by the reported level of ANC they offered and the high end design. They seemed to check all the boxes of what I was looking for and having apt-x low latency Bluetooth was a must have in my situation so I decided to plug my nose and pay an additional $250 over the APM’s and oh boy am I glad I did. The quality, ANC and comfort are next level. They feel a hell of a lot lighter on my head than the APM’s did and when I move my head around they stay in place unlike the APM’s. Also, there’s an actual on/off button and the dual dials for volume and transparency mode are way nicer than the design of the APM’s. Also, being able to connect to my TV and my phone simultaneously is just icing on the cake for me compared to the APM’s where you could only connect to one device at a time. Oh and the battery life….WOW…it just seems to last for days and days on one charge using them at least 6hrs/day.Conclusion: Avoid the APM’s at all cost (you’ve been warned) and “buy once, cry once” and get these headphones. You won’t regret it!

This is the first time I purchase B&O. In the past I have tried many model of them but I decided not to buy because the sound dynamic quite too light for me. But not for H95, sounds are crisp, great dynamic and wide range of sound.So impressed and glad I decide to buy.

Great build quality. Easy to set up and connect to my iPhone. Good ANC. You can adjust EQ and settings with the downloadable app. Great soundstage and extreme highs and lows. Comes with nice aluminum carry case. Volume control through the app, your phone or there is a large nov integrated into the earpiece you can turn to adjust volume on the right and the one on the left adjust the degree of ANC or transparency. I’m happy with them.

 Like most, the cost of the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones kept me from trying them. I first bought and loved the Beoplay HX headphones but kept feeling something was lacking. I had to adjust the EQ regularly to “fix” the sound as it would sometimes be too harsh in the high end or the bass might distort a bit at high volume. Also felt the round ear cups were not ideal for creating a seal to allow the noise cancellation to do what it is supposed to do. The H95’s were still the ones I wanted, ever since I saw them announced but the cost held me back. Finally I had to give in and ordered them and I can honestly say I do not regret it. They are without a doubt the best sounding wireless headphones I have tried and I have tried many, many wireless headphones over the last two years. I currently own the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX, The Air Pods Max and the Technics A800 Headphones. The H95’s blow them all out of the water, at least for me.Sound is subjective, everyone hears things differently but for me these have the best sound out of the box of any I have tried. I also tried models from Sony, Bowers & Wilkins, Master & Dynamic, Sennheiser and more. These sound so good, with incredible depth, detail, and the soundstage is immersive and clear. Bass is strong but not overwhelming. Those seeking heavy bass might be disappointed but I think it sounds just right. Others have said they think they don’t get loud enough and I can hear that, definitely older tracks that have not been remastered will show off the weakness in the recording but for me most everything I have listened to sounds awesome and for me they are loud enough. The noise cancelling is surprisingly good, especially when music is playing it blocks a good amount of outside sounds. No doubt some are better (like Sony or Bose) but these are up there near the top of the list. Also the build quality is the best, really beautiful looking headphones, starting with the aluminum case they come in, the braided cords that fit into the compartment inside the case (with leather snap straps to hold them) and the headphones themselves are made of premium materials like aluminum and leather and fold up to fit inside the case. The ear cup pads are held with magnets and are easy to remove and replace (like the Air Pods Max do) and the oval shape lends to better sound isolation and comfort. These headphones just feel like something luxurious on your head. They have a little more clamping force than the HX which some might have issue with but I found it perfect as the HX’s felt more loose and like they might fall off my head at times (although they haven't as of yet). The Titanium drivers allow for better sound than is found on the HX (which are still good, just not as good, especially in direct comparison to the H95’s). Battery life is very good, as expected, but individual mileage varies on usage, volume and ANC settings and such. And i do love the dials on the ear cups for adjusting volume (right ear cup) and ANC/Transparency (left ear cup). It’s a nice touch. The only fault I can really find with these headphones is the touch control can be finicky for sure, but usually works, and there are no wear sensors to stop/start playback when you remove/replace the headphones but since this feature doesn’t always work properly on some headphones I have used I don’t really need it. If price is not an issue, I highly recommend the H95 headphones…If cost is an issue, I still love the HX and they do have wear sensors, and they are a slightly more reasonably priced alternative, especially when on sale. I cannot say enough good things about the H95’s and the Bang & Olufsen brand! I am spoiled now and will be hard pressed to use any other headphone! I haven’t even tried them wired as of yet, I hear they are great wired too, but I really only want to be free of wires, otherwise why buy wireless headphones? As they say “you get what you pay for” and I think these headphones are well worth it!Update: decided to try the H95’s wired and they sound simply  incredible! I’m truly impressed. You do have to use power when wired so there is that to take into consideration and that may be why the wired sound is so awesome! I would not normally use them wired but it’s nice to have as an option, especially as good as they sound. And as mentioned above, the cords are durable braided cords for longevity and endurance. A really nice touch! One thing I discovered: the assistant button is supposed to be a long press to activate your assistant, in my case Siri, but it did not work at all. It’s supposed to be a long press to activate and a double press to cancel or deactivate, so I tried the double tap and it worked to activate Siri, at least on my unit. So if you find the long press not working, try the double tap. (I don’t really use it that much anyway but it’s good to know it does work after all). Update: a recent firmware update has improved the responsiveness of the touch control, it will pause/play quicker than before with less of a delay in the sound starting or stopping. Still my favorite wireless noise cancelling headphones!

I was lucky enough to get B&O HX on Amazon prime day deal for a bargain price of £300.From the moment I put the HX on i was blown away by the build quality,sound and even the noise cancelling.But I was always curious as to why the B&O 95 were £750.... £300 more than the HX (at full price) and when looking at the specs didn't seem to have £300 worth of differences.Both use the same drivers.Both made from the same materials.Both using the same Bluetooth codecs.But my curiosity got the better of me so I decided to order a pair to see if I was missing something.On arrival I will admit the unboxing experience is the best I have ever had.The box they come in is very premium and looks like it's holding a premium product inside.The headphones carry case is all metal and looks amazing but not so great if you intend on using it to travel as it will scratch very easily and dosent fold down flat when not in use so takes up a lot of room in a bag.When you open the headphones case you are treated to a very nice looking pair of headphones.B&O Tradition oozing with style.These headphones look stunning and are very well built.The rest of the accessories in the box.. charging cable,audio jack and flight adaptor also follow suit with premium materials used.You know these headphones are made to last year's and years which I must admit is something I really like from B&O.But after testing do I think they are better than the HX and worth the very premium price.Well it took me all of 2 hours to make my mind up.Sound.......Sound is subjective and what I like you may not so I'm just going to say that I love the sound of the HX and the 95 sound exactly the same.I was very surprised but disappointed by this. As I said I love the sound of the HX but was expecting to be blown away by the 95'sThe only thing I could tell after doing an A/B comparison is the 95's have a bit more bass but I don't think it's to do with driver tuning it's coming from the fact that the 95's have oval earcups and a stronger clamp force than the HX which helps with bass reproduction.Other than that both headphones get plenty loud and sound crisp clear and have a great soundstage.Battery.95s have a better battery lasting 38 hours compared to the 35 hours of the HX.Noise cancelling...Noise cancelling on the 95's are better than the HX but not by a mind blowing amount.ControlsBoth headphones use a combination of touch controls and physical buttons. Few differences between the 2 is that the 95's use dials located on the earcups to control sound and also ANC.Turn the right dial and that adjust the volume and use the left dial to adjust the level of ANC/Ambient sound.Great idea but when using them the dials felt like they were scraping a bit and didn't feel butter smooth which I was expecting but still did the job.The HX on the other had use the touch pad for volume(rotate your finger around the outside of the touch pad increases/decreases the volume).Fornthe ANC you have a button on the left cup which when pressed cycles through the ANC/Ambient or off modes.Both use the touch pad for track skip,paly/pause and to answer and reject phone calls.One advantage the HX has over the 95s is auto pause.So when you take the HX off your head when listening to music they will stop playing and then resume when you put them back on.Was very surprised to see that the 95's don't support this feature.Weight.Neither headphones are very heavy but the 95's have the heavier of the 2 which I did notice but was possibly due to the fact I have been using the HX for a week prior but it didn't cause discomfort.Final thoughts.When comparing the 2 as I have done I can't recommend these as for the price the differences just don't add up.Better battery (just)Better ANC (just)Build and sound (same)Honestly if you are considering these headphones give the cheaper HX a shot. I guarantee you won't be disappointed and you will still have a loads of cash left to buy the wife/husband something nice to and even take them out for tea 😁Thanks for reading and I hope this helped in your purchase decision 👍

Avevo le Bose QC 35 II, ma posso dire che solo da oggi ascolto veramente ogni strumento della mia musica preferita, grazie alle H95. La qualità del suono è da brividi. Ma il volume massimo è troppo basso. Mi sembra strano che un prodotto di questa fascia di prezzo non ti dia la possibilità di andare oltre il necessario e il raccomandabile, quando se ne avesse voglia.Ma non si può in tutta onesta parlare male di questo prodotto. È una meraviglia.Per passare da un dispositivo all’altro fra quelli abbinati, bisogna spegnere manualmente quelli che non si vuole ascoltare; in base al prezzo pagato, uno si aspetterebbe una app con questa funzionalità (stile Bose).

Vorab, Sound ist wie Schönheit und Kunst im allgemeinen Geschmackssache, subjektiv sowie individuell. Jeder hat so seine eigenen Vorstellungen wie die Musik klingen sollte, damit sie als perfekt bezeichnet werden kann.Als Zuspieler für die Bewertung dienten ein Onkyo Granbeat dp-cmx1, FiiO X7, Surface Book 2 und Pixel 6 Pro (Onkyo HF Player). Die Musikdateien lagen ausschließlich in FLAC von HD bis UHD vor und wurden per Bluetooth sowie Kabel an den Beoplay gesendet. Für das Streamen wurden Qobuz und AMAZON genutzt. Zum Vergleich habe ich den Bose 700 ANC, DUNU DK 2001, Onkyo E900, FiiO EX1, Beoplay H5, H9 und den Technics EAH AZ60 hinzugezogen.Der Beoplay H95 ist B&O typisch ein Design Produkt, welches sich optisch und vor allem in der Materialwahl stark von der Konkurrenz absetzt. Entgegen dem Groh an Kopfhörern besteht der Beoplay zum Großteil aus Metall und echtem Leder, während sich bei der Konkurrenz das Verhältnis exakt umgekehrt verhält und viel Kunstleder zum Einsatz kommt, einfach nicht vergleichbar. Die Bedienung via Lünetten für ANC und Lautstärke sind ebenfalls bei keinem anderen Kopfhörer zu haben und funktionieren perfekt. Tipp-/Wischgesten für vor/zurück/Gesprächsannahme usw. finde ich besser als Taster, schließlich haben alle IN EAR Kopfhörer ebenfalls diese Funktionen, warum nicht auch OVER EAR Kopfhörer!?! Sehr gut gemacht B&O. Diese Art der Bedienung hatte mir schon bei meinem 4 Jahre alten Beoplay H9 1.Gen. seht gut gefallen (tipp und wisch Funktionen). Auch hat mein H9 noch keine Alterungserscheinungen an den Tag gelegt, weder musikalischer, materialer Art noch was den Akku anbelangt. Bei Kopfhörern mit Kunstleder Ohrmuscheln habe ich schon das eine oder andere Mal gehabt, das sich das Kunststoff auflösende Gebrösel an Kopf und Ohren klebte und ich aus diesem Grund auch nicht den Technics EAH A800 geordert (Bestellung zu Gunsten des H95 bei AMAZON gecancelt) habe. Ja, aufgrund der hochwertigen Materialien und der Verwendung von Aluminium ist der Kopfhörer nicht gerade leicht, trägt sich aber sehr angenehm, ohne das man den Eindruck bekommt, einen schweren Kopfhörer aufzuhaben. Das liegt zum einen an den sehr gut die Ohren umschließenden Hörmuscheln (habe keine kleinen Lauscher) und dem gut gepolsterten Bügel. Die Verarbeitung ist ausgezeichnet! Kein knacken oder knarzen wie beim Bose 700 ANC (Kunststoff und Kunstleder wohin das Auge sieht, aber auch viel leichter!).Bevor ein musikalisches Urteil über einen Kopfhörer gefällt werden kann, sollte dieser min. 20 Stunden betrieben worden sein. Technik braucht immer etwas Zeit um sich Einzuspielen, im besonderen Kopfhörer wie auch der Beoplay H95. Nach der Einspielzeit klingen die Kopfhörer ohne Anpassung des EQ (via Beoplay App) für mich bereits perfekt. Sehr schöner, exakter Tiefbass, lebendige Mitten und präzise Höhen. Das Klangbild des H95 ist sehr ausgewogen und bildet eine große Bühne ab. Hierbei sind die einzelnen Instrumente lokalisierbar und man kann ihnen während der Wiedergabe verifiziert folgen. Sehr gut klappt dies bei Otis Taylor / Nasty Letter, Evanescence / Synthesis, Steve Jablonsky / Transformer: Age of Extinction oder Thorbjorn Risager & The Black Tornado / Best Of. Klassik, Dance wie auch Rock oder Pop klingen sehr gut und für mich besser als beim Bose 700 ANC sowie Technics EAH AZ60. Der Bose hat zwar auch den Tiefbass, zeichnet ihn aber nicht so sauber ab wie der Beoplay H95. Auch wenn die DUNU DK 2001 und Onkyo E900 vier Treiber für die Abbildung der Musik nutzen, ist der Sound nicht so harmonisch wie beim H95 und Stellenweise bei den Höhen überspitzt (zuweilen unangenehm wie bei der Wiedergabe von INXS Songs).Das Pixcel 6 Pro hat sich zudem als sehr würdiger Zuspieler für alle Kopfhörer beim Vergleich herausgestellt, solange die Onkyo HF Player App genutzt wird! Die Poweramp App kommt klanglich nicht an die Onkyo App heran, egal ob die Musik per Blutooth oder Kabel (DAC zu USB C notwendig) zugespielt wird. Die bei einigen hier abgegebenen Bewertungen bemängelte max. Lautstärke des H95 kann ich nicht bestätigen. Vermutlich liegt es hierbei an der verwendeten Player App, den Geräteeinstellungen oder dem Streaming Dienst. Ich konnte diese Erfahrungen ebenfalls machen und würde empfehlen, am Smartphone einen andere Player zu verwenden und die Bluetooth Einstellungen zu überprüfen.Die Multikonnektivität ist wie bei den Technics EAH AZ60 sehr praktisch, wenn man mit dem Rechner sowie Smartphon zugleich verbunden ist und während einer Filmwiedergabe auf dem Rechner problemlos das Telefongespräche annehmen kann.Neben der sehr hohen Verarbeitungsqualität, der Optik sowie Haptik war ein weiteres Kaufargument die lange Akkulaufzeit. Hier wurde ich nicht enttäuscht und die angegebenen 38h werden bei meiner Lautstärkewahl problemlos erreicht. Leider ist der Akku nicht mehr wie beim Beoplay H9 eigenständig wechselbar.Ja, 800,- € sind eine menge Holz für einen Kopfhörer, aber er ist aus meiner Sicht und in Anbetracht der verwendeten Materialien, der Verarbeitung und dem Klang das Geld wert. Wer einen wertigen, langlebigen und sehr gut spielenden Kopfhörer sucht, dem kann ich den Beoplay H95 empfehlen.

Ich hatte den H95 neben dem Bowers&Wilkens P7 S2 zwei Wochen intensiv in Betrieb. Musik hören über PC, iPhone 11 und meinen etwas in die Jahre gekommenen, aber immer noch hervorragenden Digital Audio Player Astell&Kern KANN - jeweils über Bluetooth und über Kabel. Dann noch viele Telefonkonferenzen über Bluetooth mit dem iPhone und dem PC - zumeist allerdings in eher ruhigen Umgebungen.In Kürze: ich fand den H95 sehr ausgeglichen und angenehm im Klang. Mehr Bass (für mich manchmal etwas zu prominent aber nie schwammig) und vielleicht etwas weniger Details speziell in den Höhen als der P7 S2, aber insgesamt sehr präzise und nie anstrengend. Bei längeren Musiksessions fand ich den H95 insgesamt harmonischer und schöner als den P7 S2 und auch angenehmer auf dem Kopf. Allerdings sind das am Ende nur sehr kleine Unterschiede und beide gehören sicherlich zu den besten ANC Bluetooth Kopfhörern die ich bislang gehört habe - und da waren einige von Bose, Sony und Sennheiser dabei. Ich würde sagen, zwischen H95 und P7 S2 entscheiden am Ende für mich die persönlichen Präferenzen was das Klangbild angeht (H95 wärmer und mehr Bass, P7 S2 etwas luftiger und eine kleinen Tick präziser in den Höhen).Ich habe trotzdem beide zurückgeschickt. Neben dem Musikgenuss muss ein ANC Kopfhörer bei mir sehr gute Leistungen beim Telefonieren und in Videokonferenzen bringen. Insbesondere die Verständlichkeit für den Gesprächspartner bei der Verwendung in nicht ganz ruhigen Umgebungen ist für mich von hoher Relevanz. Beide Kopfhörer machen da in ruhigen Umgebungen eine guten Job, wenn es um mich herum lauter wird kommen aber zunehmend Nachfragen vom Gesprächspartner. Es geht zwar auch dann noch, aber die Leistung ist nicht ganz auf dem Niveau meines aktuellen Bose NC700 und sicherlich deutlich schlechter als beim neuen Sony XM5. So gut wie mein aktueller Bose NC700 sollte ein neuer ANC BT Kopfhörer aber in dieser Disziplin definitiv sein - insbesondere bei den für den H95 und den P7 S2 üblicherweise aufgerufenen Preisen. Also geht auch der H95 zurück obwohl ich ihn tatsächlich für ‚nur‘ 568€ auf Amazon bekommen habe. Üblicherweise liegt er ja bei 700€ oder mehr und dafür ist er meines Erachtens einfach nicht gut genug.Sobald verfügbar werde ich den angekündigten Bowers&Wilkens P8 als potentiellen Kandidaten mit meinem mittlerweile mit einiger Verzögerung eingetroffenen neuen Astell&Kern SE180 DAP testen. Obwohl die Nutzung für Konferenzen und Telefonie sich - zumindest wenn man die technischen Spezifikationen zugrunde legt - wohl nicht erheblich von der Leistung des P7 S2 unterscheiden wird. Ich bin gespannt …

Ero abbastanza indeciso se acquistarle, dato il prezzo non indifferente, anche con lo sconto del Blak Friday. Possiedo già le B&O H9 che già suonano piuttosto bene, e le Sennheiser momentum 3, che pure sono delle buone cuffie. Cosa mi ha spinto a prenderle?  Devo dire che già amo il suono definito e pulito delle B&O, poi avendo letto comunque delle più che buone recensioni sulle H95, alla fine mi sono deciso. E non mi sono pentito.Le cuffie sono comode, anche se un po' grandi. La portata del bluetooth è ottima, vado in giro per tutta casa senza che perdano il segnale. E infine il suono... Devo ancora finire il rodaggio di una quarantina di ore di ascolto, ma già la differenza con le altre cuffie bluetooth che possiedo si sente, eccome. Ottima spazialità e scena sonora, ottima definizione dei timbri e dei bassi, che sono caldi ed avvolgenti. Naturalmente dipende molto anche dalla sorgente sonora per avere il miglior risultato, ma ascoltate con dei file a 24 bit in Hi Res in alcuni brani sono spettacolari. Provato ad ascoltare la versione 2022 di Comfortably numb di Roger Waters: stupefacente la ricchezza del suono e la qualità dei dettagli. Ascolto anche molta classica, e il finale del terzo atto della Walchiria di Wagner nella registrazione di Solti è stato davvero emozionante. C'è chi ha lamentato il non alto volume raggiunto, ma francamente non ho sentito il bisogno di alzare il volume al massimo. Vado spesso a concerti dal vivo, specie con strumenti acustici, e conosco bene suoni e volumi di strumenti musicali e voci non amplificati. A me interessa la pulizia e la qualità del suono, e con le H95 l'ho trovato. Non ho termini di paragone con le cuffie cablate, poiché per mia comodità preferisco le bluetooth. Però penso che fra queste ultime sono probabilmente la scelta migliore che uno possa fare. Buon ascolto!!

Ich ersetze mit dem H95 Kopfhörer den ebenfalls schon sehr guten H9 3. Generation. Tatsächlich liegen Welten zwischen den beiden Kopfhörern was Tragekomfort und Klang betrifft.Bereits das Öffnen der Schachtel und das erste Öffnen der Metallbox sind ein absolutes Erlebnis! Die Wertigkeit der Materialien ist auf allerhöchstem Niveau und erfüllt so höchste Ansprüche. Noch nie wurde ich haptisch und optisch so überwältigt - auch wenn man das bei einem derartigen Kaufpreis erwarten muss! Das setzt sich beim Entfalten und Aufsetzen des Kopfhörers fort. Das Leder, die Metallapplikationen, die Tasten und Schalter: Alles wirkt edel und höchstwertig.Das Koppeln und Einrichten über die B&O App funktioniert tadellos. Die Oberfläche der App gefällt mir sehr gut. Die Einstellmöglichkeiten sind klar gegliedert und leicht verständlich.Zum Einstellen des Klangs werden einige voreingestellte Presets angeboten. Man hat aber auch die Möglichkeit den Klang über einen frei bewegbaren Kreis in verschiedene Ebenen zu bewegen und so die Abstimmung des DSP zu beeinflussen.Verglichen mit dem auch schon schweren H9 sitzt der H95 um ein Vielfaches besser. Allein durch die längliche Form der Hörer und die deutlich weichere Schäumung des Kopfbügels verbessern den Tragekomfort erheblich. Trotz seines unfassbar hohen Gewichts ist stundenlanges Tragen kein Problem.Endgeil finde ich auch die Drehringe an den Hörern, mit denen sich links ANC und rechts die Lautstärke einstellen lassen.Erstes ProbehörenEinziger Kritikpunkt vorweg: Die maximal wählbare Lautstärke stellt im Bluetooth-Betrieb leider nicht zufrieden. Erstaunlicherweise gibt der H95 auch bei Verwendung mit Klinkenkabel viel zu wenig Power aus. Bei dem H9 konnte ich mit Kabel eine deutlich höhere Lautstärke erzielen und damit die wahren Qualitäten des Kopfhörers nutzen.Das mag sicherlich am verwendeten Ausgabegerät liegen (iPhone 12, ipad pro, dell inspiron g7), doch im Alltag hat man selten einen Kopfhörerverstärker oder einen AV-Receiver bei sich. Ich wünsche mir einfach mehr Punch! Dafür ziehe ich einen Stern ab! B&O ist nicht der einzige Hersteller, der zu wenig Lautstärke bietet. Es scheint ein allgemeines Problem zu sein - wahrscheinlich zurückzuführen auf Verordnungen durch Gesetzgeber zum Schutz der Allgemeinheit.Der H95 spielt kraftvoll und klar. Es gibt keine Frequenz, die der Hörer nicht kennt. Einfach jedes versteckte Detail kommt zum Vorschein. Es ist ein absoluter Genuss mit dem H95 Musik zu hören. Dabei spielt es keine Rolle, welche Musikrichtung man wählt. Einfach alles wird perfekt wiedergegeben.Kraftvolle und tiefe Bässe, nie dagewesene Details aus Mitten und Höhen. Chapeau! Ein Kopfhörer, der die Musik so wiedergibt, wie es sich die Studios vorstellen.Das ANC lässt sich in 5 Stufen einstellen. Verglichen mit dem Bose 700 Kopfhörer empfinde ich das ANC als gleichwertig und somit besser als beim H9. Ein tolles Feature ist die Funktion „Windgeräusche unterdrücken“. Damit funktioniert ANC bis zu einem gewissen Grad auch dann, wenn man sich beispielsweise auf dem Balkon aufhält und Windböen vorbei wehen.Bleibt nur das Manko der zu geringen Lautstärke. Wer es so wie ich gerne lauter mag, der wird zumindest in Verbindung mit Smartphone, Tablet oder Laptop enttäuscht werden. Ich werde ein Update geben, sobald ich den H95 mit einem Kopfhörerverstärker getestet habe.UPDATEDer Betrieb mit einem Kopfhörerverstärker von Neoteck brachte kaum Besserung. Bevor ich die Lautstärke auf ein gewünschtes Niveau bringen konnte, fing der Verstärker bereits an zu verzerren. Als würde der Kopfhörer das Eingangssignal bewusst auf das vorgesehene Limit absenken. Bei einem derartigen Kaufpreis ist so etwas m.E. nicht hinnehmbar. Daher schicke ich den H95 zurück.

Une réduction du bruit pas au niveau des ténors que sont Sony, Apple et Bose.Il ne rechigne pas au niveau qualité audio, sa restitution est très ample et riche.Qualité des matériaux utilisés pour la construction du casque.Confort va être variable, de mon point de vue, avec le port de lunettes cela devient gênant avant une heure d’écoute.

update:  I've had an ear-cup fall off a couple of times while removing these headphones.Maybe a combination of hot weather, a bald head and weak magnets are too blame but a bit annoying on an expensive pair of headphones like this.Deducted a star.First and foremost I bought these for the audio quality, a detailed and airy sound with plenty of controlled bass when needed. Just amazing how far bluetooth headphones have come in recent years.Next plus would be the build quality...materials and construction that will, hopefully, stand the test of time (well, at least the a few years, unlike some previous headphones I have used).I also really appreciate having a physical on/off toggle  and the volume/anc dials...take those any day over press and hold type affairs.Now for a couple of negatives:The price. ouch. Got these on prime day sale (below £600) but, for me, still at the very outer reaches of a justifiable price for bluetooth headphones.The volume and anc dials, while superior over touch or press and hold buttons, feel cheap and out of odds with the build standard of the rest of the headphones.The ear cups could be a little bigger, a bit  of a snug fit but otherwise a comfortable wear.I think the good battery life and bluetooth connection are now pretty much standard and much less of an issue/selling point on previous generations , though still thankful for both.That's about it, would definitely recommend if within your budget.For sound reference I have had a Bower's PX (buttons stopped working), PX7s (hinge broke) and Sennheiser Momentum 3 ( recently started getting constant static in one cup) plus a Hifiman Sundara and a few other headphones, amps and such.

Parto dal fatto che la mia scelta e dettata esclusivamente dalla qualità del suono che le cuffie sono in grado di riprodurre fedelmente, tutto il resto è irrilevante per me.Raramente ho sentito dei suoni così dettagliati e puliti come con queste B&O H95 e considerando che sono molto esigente posso confermare tranquillamente che valgono i soldi spesi. Sono veramente soddisfatto. Un suono corposo, immersivo, pulito e ricco di dettagli. Queste cuffie sono adatte ad ogni genere di musica. Qualcuno critica che  non raggiungono volumi altissimi (da sballo) ma devo dire che non si sente l’esigenza dato l’ottimo lavoro dell’ANC, ed inoltre, personalmente do più valore all’alta qualità del suono che al “rumore” riprodotto da tante cuffie in commercio. Riascolto i miei album come se fosse per la prima volta. Eccezionale.

Vengo de unos Sony WH-1000XM4.Tras dos días con estos auriculares volví a coger mis antiguos Sony y parecen un juguete, de verdad.En comparación con dichos Sony, la cancelación de ruido es algo peor, pero compensa en todo lo demás (en los viajes de avión por ejemplo, recuerdo que la de los Sony era más eficiente).El acabado es increíble, cosa que también hace que pesen más que los Sony que están hechos de plástico, pero lo prefiero así.En resumen, muy contento con la compra, teniendo en cuenta, claro, el precio en oferta al que he tenido la suerte de comprarlos.

Da appassionato di alta fedeltà ho provato diverse altre cuffie over-ear di altri produttori (Sony e Bose principalmente).Sulla qualità dei materiali produttivi anche il meno esperto si rende subito conto dell'eccellenza dei materiali costruttivi (decisamente no vegan) che differenziano queste cuffie ancora prima di accenderle ed abbinarle al proprio dispositivo.Che dire, stiamo parlando di un prodotto super premium che, anche se testato con connessioni bluetooth a 256kbps fa sentire da subito la differenza con altri prodotti di fascia medio alta (parliamo di cuffie da 350/450 in su). Qui i materiali utilizzati e il software di gestione B&O fanno sicuramente la differenza, non c'è da discutere.L'equilibrio che si percepisce (senza mettere mano all'equalizzazione) è senza uguali. Bassi pieni, caldi, avvolgenti, eleganti... medi e alti puliti e ben bilanciati. L'app di B&O permette poi di adattare in una maniera semplice ed immediata di lavorare manualmente sull'equalizzazione in base al tipo di brano che si ascolta.Uso Apple Music e ho testato diversi tipi di brani sia in formato loseless, che master e in Dolby Atmos, nonostante i limiti del bluethoot (v. 5.1) la differza si sente rispetto a piattaforme come Spotify.La presenza di ghiere meccaniche per agire sul volume e sulla cancellazione del rumore/trasparenza sono la ciliegina sulla torta su un prodotto che, a parer mio, rimane il migliore sul mercato. La qualità ha un prezzo ma in questo caso, direi che ne vale decisamente la pena.

Also klar, das ist eine Menge Geld die aufgerufen wird. Ich kann jetzt nur mit dem Sony WH-1000XM3 vergleichen und das ist schon ein großer Unterschied. Angefangen von der Haptik und dem Sitz, bis hin zum Klang. Der Hörer vermittel das Gefühl von hochwertigen Materialien und er sitzt nahezu pefekt (das ist bei mir eher schwierig. Genial die Steuerung des bluetooth players, das funzt richtig gut, gerade was die Lautstärke betrift. Ich füttere den H95 mit einem Sony  NW-A105 und alles mögliche von Rock, Pop, Jazz. Der Hörer hat eine feine, breite Bühne und löst sehr klar und differenziert auf. Da höre ich Details die dem Sony verborgen blieben.Einzig die Geräuschunterdrückung ist mäßig. Die kommt weder an den Sony noch an einen Bose irgendwie ran. Ja es ist eine gewisse Geräuscjunterdrückung da, aber eben nicht in dem sinne wie beim Sony bei dem man den Eindruck hat man ist in inerisloierten Blase. Also da hääte B&O besser investieren können.Aber gut ich behalte ihn trotzdem, einfach weil der Klang einmalig ist. Ob es andere Hörer für weniger Geld gibt die den gleichen Klang bieten können..... kann ich nicht sagen, ich gönne mir den jetzt und fruee mich auf jede Gelegenheit ihn aufzusetzen.

Build Quality - Amazing, including a aluminium carry case. Bit bulky for use on the fly, but definitely protects them if you need to throw them in a bag etc.Sound Quality - Almost as good as some high end wired options.

ANC is very good, but if that's your main feature you're looking for, the Sony XM4s and 5s would be a better choice. Still decent tho.Overall, really happy with these and enjoying using them.

Ich habe auf der Suche nach nem Ersatz für meine Sony Wh1000mx3 mehrere Kopfhörer ausprobiert. Der Beoplay 95 war der mit Abstand teuerste von allen. Und er wird seinem Preis in keinster Weise gerecht. Aber immer mal langsam.Wie schon andere hier berichtet haben ist das Auspacken des Beoplay ein wahres Erlebnis. Man merkt definitiv dass man es hier mit einem Prestigeobjekt zu tun hat. Sowohl das Hardcase als auch der Kopfhörer bestehen aus Aluminium. Das gibt dem ganzen ein sehr hochwertiges Gefühl. Generell lässt sich an der Verarbeitung des Kopfhörers absolut nicht aussetzen.Tja, und damit wären wir schon am Ende der Liste mit den Positiven Dingen.Der Kopfhörer ist meiner Meinung nach sehr Unbequem. Er sitzt sehr eng auf den Ohren. Da hilft auch kein Lammleder. Klanglich ist er ebenso eine gewaltige Enttäuschung. Bei dem Preis erwartet man eine akustische Massage des Gehörgangs. Stattdessen erhält man keinen Bass, dafür aber extrem aufdringliche Höhen. Nach dem gefühlt 20gsten Versuch den Kopfhörer mit der dazugehörigen App zu koppeln hatte ich dann auch endlich Mal Erfolg. Leider kann man die App komplett vergessen. Ein Equalizer ist nicht vorhanden, stattdessen kann man aus verschiedenen Klangmodi wählen. Und kaum hab ich da was ausgewählt ist plötzlich nur noch Stöhnen und Krächzen zu hören. Auch zurückschalten hat das Problem nicht behoben.An dem Punkt hab ich den Kopfhörer wieder eingepackt und die Rücksendung veranlasst. ANC hab ich dann nicht mehr getestet.Für diesen Preis so einen Mist anzubieten sollte schon fast verboten werden. Der Kopfhörer sieht toll aus und an der Verarbeitung und Verpackung hat man definitiv nicht gespart, aber zu der Technik lässt sich bei aller Liebe nichts positives sagen. Schade.

I’m not an audiophile. My AirPods stopped working so I decided I wanted to try on-ear noise canceling headphones with a long battery life. My primary intention is to use them for work calls.I ordered the Bose QC45, very happy with them (I should also mention I was happy with the sound from my basic AirPods before). Except I couldn’t wear them for longer than an hour because my ears would start profusely sweating??? I googled this and turns out it’s a thing! Some people get hot ears from the synthetic material of the ear cups.The main reason I ordered these was because of the leather ear cups. It worked! No more sweaty ears. My ears are bigger than the round part, maybe that’s why, but I still find them very comfortable. Given the “lack of seal” I find the ANC to be fine for my needs.One thing I find annoying is that to put them back in their case, you have to slide the sides back in. They slide smoothly and aren’t notched. So basically, every time I take them out of the case I have to readjust them when I put them on, and since they’re not notched as you slide the sides out I find myself readjusting a few times.The other thing - I was getting frustrated connecting these to my windows work laptop for video calls, but then I remembered there’s an audio jack in the case so now I just use that with no issues. I don’t think they automatically connect to my iPhone like the Bose ones did, but that may be user error. It doesn’t seem like you can easily go between devices like I can with my AirPods from iPhone to MacBook. I didn’t find the app to be intuitive for this either. Hopefully I’ll eventually figure it out.Lastly, I did find that these needed to be broken in - I didn’t know that was a thing, the Bose ones didn’t. Right out of the box, music sounded like it did with my AirPods. I played with the settings, etc. For my needs I didn’t really care, I just wanted my ears to stop sweating. Then one day I was listening to music and the sound was much more impressive.I ordered the sand color, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten black. The case is light grey for these and I’m concerned about staining over time if I’m not super careful. Subjective, but I think black would probably also look more sophisticated on video calls. Overall I’m very happy with these!

Volume control, next play swipe both work fine. The noise canceling is satisfactory to me. I know there are some that may be better in that department. But they are good enough.The other high points about these are that they are very light and comfortable and after hours wearing still no issue hurting my ears or feeling heavy. They completely seal around my ears making for a truly great experience.The very long battery life is a major plus too.I've owned good headphones that only last like 4 or 5 hours and that's a deal breaker for me because I wear them all the time.Now I own numerous pairs of headphones and my Master and Dynamics mw65's are quite good too. Especially if you hook them up through an audio cable and it really increases the sound quality like 10 times better than the Bluetooth function on that pair. That's really the only way I use them. They also are a little heavy and don't make a perfect seal around the ears. But I am curious on how the new mw75's, that Master and Dynamics just came out with, sound like and if they've increased the sound quality in Bluetooth mode.Overall after about 10 hours of break in on  these B/O HX's, they sound very well. They do need a break in period.I know that everyone might not agree and are picky beyond belief, but these are worth the money. High quality build and sound. I definitely would buy again.

Very Impressive set! What stood out the most was the build quality and sounds - top notch!! Some quirks, listed below.1. Sound: OMG amazing. The finesse, the quality of sound is the best I have heard. The experience is exquisite, in that you can really pick apart instruments, vocals and mids and the bass. The lows are balanced and refined - this is not going to rattle your head, so bass head stay clear. These headphone really shine for any genre that emphasizes vocals and instruments. Volume does not get crazy, probably a good thing!2. Connectivity: Top notch, power on and instant pair. Multi device use was seamless, pause on one, easily play on the next device. Pulling connection from a third device to a paired one was a also quick.3. Build & Comfort. Excellent build, feels premium and great in the hands. My only issue was the ear cups being round and not accommodating the largish ears. Clamp force was just fine as well.4. Features: ANC vs. Normal - barely any difference. Touch controls for volume took some getting used to. Would have much preferred physical buttons.5. Call quality: sub par compared to other.Returned these with a lot of hesitation, if it physically fit me properly I would have kept and overlooked the quirks.

Sadly returning. I really wanted to like them. I love the brand and own four of their Bluetooth speakers, more importantly for years I enjoyed very much the H9i. Sadly I haven't enjoyed their new line of headphones.  I bought a pair of H95 then returned because they are quite uncomfortable, I believe this is primarily because of their excessive weight but excessive clamping force and shape of the ear pads aren't a plus either.Disappointingly not much to be excited about their sound, moreover costing just about the double of everything else out there, to possibly offset the discomfort in wearing this $900 pair of headphones.Too much disappointment for too much money.I really wanted to continue to wear the beautifully built B&O so I ordered the HX. Now I'm back in H9i territory. Very comfortable headphone built with high quality materials and with a stunning look.However while they sound better than my old  H9i and have a much improved noise cancellation circuit the HX can't compete with the incredibly refined sound of the cheaper and ultralight weight Sennheiser Momentum 4 nor with their even better noise cancellation feature.I really hated the idea to return the stunning looking HX but the sound of the Momentum 4 is so superior  that the far superior aesthetics of the HX was not enough to win me.

For the price you pay, it's annoying instead of comfortable!First, it's impossible to have it for a long time. The headphone is heavy and you want to remove them for a while. Second, ear cups are round instead of oval. As such, it feels weird around your ears.The sound quality is good and volume control is super easy. I had no issues with connections or noise cancelation. Overall, if I could I would return it (I did not use it for three months and I did not have the opportunity to return it anymore)

Pros:- Very high quality materials- Beautiful design- ComfortableCons:- Volume control unusable for me. After several hours of practice I still couldn't control it reliably or oftentimes at all.- Sound quality very disappointing. Not awful, just not nearly as good as I'd hoped.Deal-breakers for me on any headphone or earbud are shouty, sibilant treble and fiddly controls. The HXs suffer from fiddly controls. I could swipe forward and back pretty reliably, but volume control was well nigh impossible for me.The sound quality was warm and smooth, but it really lacked any life at all in the top end. I know I'm fussy; first I don't want shouty treble and then I say I want life and liveliness in the top end. Well, I want what I want. For reference, my AirPods Max have life in the top end, which only ever overpowers me on poorly-mixed tracks. Ditto for sibilant consonants.I gave the HXs a go because I wanted a better wired option than my AirPods Max or my Jabra 85h for listening connected to a DAC. The Jabras have a very good sound, but Apple Music Hi-Res lossless and TIDAL MQA expose a thin-sounding weak spot in the male vocal range that gets annoying after a while. I'm looking for something better. I know the Jabras and the HXs are primarily bluetooth headphones, but I wanted something that could be wired for Hi-Res listening without jumping into the deep end of the pool of audiophile wired headphones.I'm returning these for the (essentially) broken volume control design.

I have tried quite a few headphones and these are the best of the lot for me. The fit, sound, voice quality, battery life and stability are terrific.

I’m not an audiophile. My AirPods stopped working so I decided I wanted to try on-ear noise canceling headphones with a long battery life. My primary intention is to use them for work calls.I ordered the Bose QC45, very happy with them (I should also mention I was happy with the sound from my basic AirPods before). Except I couldn’t wear them for longer than an hour because my ears would start profusely sweating??? I googled this and turns out it’s a thing! Some people get hot ears from the synthetic material of the ear cups.The main reason I ordered these was because of the leather ear cups. It worked! No more sweaty ears. My ears are bigger than the round part, maybe that’s why, but I still find them very comfortable. Given the “lack of seal” I find the ANC to be fine for my needs.One thing I find annoying is that to put them back in their case, you have to slide the sides back in. They slide smoothly and aren’t notched. So basically, every time I take them out of the case I have to readjust them when I put them on, and since they’re not notched as you slide the sides out I find myself readjusting a few times.The other thing - I was getting frustrated connecting these to my windows work laptop for video calls, but then I remembered there’s an audio jack in the case so now I just use that with no issues. I don’t think they automatically connect to my iPhone like the Bose ones did, but that may be user error. It doesn’t seem like you can easily go between devices like I can with my AirPods from iPhone to MacBook. I didn’t find the app to be intuitive for this either. Hopefully I’ll eventually figure it out.Lastly, I did find that these needed to be broken in - I didn’t know that was a thing, the Bose ones didn’t. Right out of the box, music sounded like it did with my AirPods. I played with the settings, etc. For my needs I didn’t really care, I just wanted my ears to stop sweating. Then one day I was listening to music and the sound was much more impressive.I ordered the sand color, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten black. The case is light grey for these and I’m concerned about staining over time if I’m not super careful. Subjective, but I think black would probably also look more sophisticated on video calls. Overall I’m very happy with these!

I did truly love these headphones. I'm a fan of the aesthetics and sound. I've tried many headphones, looking for the ones that play music to my ears. I did return these though due to my ears not fitting completely under the ear pad. No discomfort, even after hours of listening but found it to be troublesome with creating a good seal. Another note, there is circular engraving in the ear cups. There are also earcup commands by swiping on them. The engraving can be quite annoying when trying to skip songs due to your finger naturally wanting to follow the engraving.Still overall great headphones. Can't comment on noise cancelling as it's not really a feature I pay attention to. Isnt the whole point of it to not pay attention? Cant be bad then.

These are absolutely beautiful headphones and the sound is very good.

Swiping in the other direction went back maybe 50% of the time. The volume control sometimes responds and mostly doesn’t.You can control music from the app on your phone but who wants to do that.

Just wanted to mention that I did not buy these from Amazon, I bought them directly from the B&O online store.I'm going to be truthful because I'm a big fan of B&O. The Beoplay HXs sound, feel, and look very amazing. I don't know really where to start the review.Sound quality: Your typical B&O sound quality. Beautiful, clean, crisp, doesn't sacrifice any instrument, thumping bass but it's not obnoxious or distorts other instruments and/or vocals. Music separation is fantastic. Not like open back or closed-back headphones that are meant to be plugged into an AMP/DAC but it's damn near close. My favorite out-of-the-box sound signature/sound quality brand of headphones where I don't have to tweak the EQ (that much) is B&O, Sennheiser, Monolith, Master & Dynamic, Audeze, and Grado.Battery: B&O claims a 35-hour battery with ANC n and a few more hours with it off. That's incredible and it's true so far. I'm very impressed with the battery.Connection: You can connect through BT or with a wire. Now, this is the one downside to these headphones. When you use the cable, you HAVE to turn the headphones on to hear audio. If I'm wrong, someone please correct me. I'm not going to deduct a star because it doesn't play a huge part to me.- The 5.1 BT connection is solid and doesn't break the connection when my phone is in my pocket or when I'm 2 floors down and left my phone on the third floor.Noise Cancelation: I've owned a pair of H9 3rd Gens and ever since owning those, I've always thought why B&O isn't taken seriously when comparing ANC to say Sony or Bose, the kings.- Let's say ANC is a 10/10 on both Sony and Bose, the HXs are a 9.5/10. Same with the 3rd Gens from what I remember.I'll say it again, I love the HXs. B&O delivers another worthy, beautiful product. What else is new?

I wouldn’t exactly consider myself an audiophile when I see how hard core some real audiophiles are. I’m not super knowledgeable on the technical side and don’t have a seemingly bottomless budget to spend on owning a wide variety of equipment. However, I do care very much about enjoying my music at the highest level of detail possible.You know the feeling you get when you invest hours into research looking for the optimal product, the product finally arrives in a package at your house, and it really is as great as you were hoping for? That’s the feeling I had the first time I tried on my new Beoplay HX’s. My goal was to find the best sounding headphones to wear out in public, whether it’s for traveling or doing work at a coffee shop or library. And I have finally found the best product for myself. I have owned multiple pairs of headphones from the Bose QC line and the Sony XM line that I used to use for this purpose. But then I spoiled myself by listening to my Sennheiser HD 660S at home too much, and Bose and Sony no longer sounded good enough for me to enjoy my music.Sound quality:Like I was saying, my primary draw to these was that I was looking for the best sound quality possible for a pair of headphones of this class. Technically, the H95 would probably be better if I like these, but they were not on my list of considerations because I was not willing to pay the $850 price tag. In terms of level of enjoyment of music, the HX’s beat all similar noise cancelling headphones I have tried, including all Bose and Sony and other Beoplay headphones. Tight and clear bass which I like, good mids, and enough treble without the fatigue. I have always had a strong dislike for fatiguing treble, because it’s tricky to get the right balance of hearing the treble well but being able to tolerate long listening sessions without the fatigue. These do an excellent job of getting the right balance.Noise cancelling:These are not best in class for noise cancelling, but they fit my standard of “good enough”. And honestly, they’re really not significantly worse than best in class. I did a side by side comparison with my Sony XM3 while playing simulated engine and coffee shop noise from a third device. And while the XM3’s did do better, I could only tell the difference with music off. With music playing, the two pairs felt similar. My standard of “good enough” means that when I’m in a noisy environment, I can enjoy my music with most of the details without needing to blast the volume. At most, I would want the volume to be one notch higher than I would keep it at home in a quiet environment. These definitely get the job done for these intents and purposes.I have also owned the H9 3rd generation and tried the Beoplay Portal, and the HX’s, at least to my ears, beat both by a decent margin. Compared to the H9 3rd, these are better in that the bass is tighter and more refined, and there’s more sparkle or clarity in the mids and treble. I read from multiple sources that the Portals were supposed to have the same drivers as the HX’s, but they don’t sound the same at all. I purchased a pair of Portals to replace my H9’s and was sorely disappointed when I tried them on. My logic was that if HX’s and Portals were really that similar, I might as well have the gaming headset option even if I don’t game that often, but they are definitely not the same in sound. I felt like the Portals were more detailed than the H9 3rd generations, but music just wasn’t enjoyable for reasons I can’t completely articulate because my technical knowledge is limited. It may have to do with the way they were tuned, in that they were designed with less of a focus on being musical and more about hearing your game environment.Comfort:In regards to comfort, the things I look for are that whey I lie down, they don’t slip off my head, ears don’t touch inside of earcup, and that I can wear them for a long period of time without uncomfortable pressure or heat in my ears. These definitely fit the criteria I listed. One of my complaints about the Sony XM series was that they would slip down the back of my head when I wanted to lie down with them due to the weight distribution. The Bose QC series were good about not having that problem. The H9 3rd gen that I owned slipped occasionally. I haven’t had much of a problem with these. Also no problem with my ears touching the inside of the earcups, which was another gripe I had with the Sony XM series.Style/design:If I’m going to be wearing my headphones in public, style or design does matter. And in my opinion, these were designed with looks in mind. In my opinion, better looking than the Sony XM series by far, still better looking than the Bose QC series, and the only competitor comparable in style is probably the Bose 700 (which don’t sound good at all). It is worth noting that these don’t collapse, so they do take up more room in my backpack compared to most competitors. But that’s a relatively small tradeoff I’m willing to make if I love the overall package.

Agree with the previous review. My main gripe is the lack of seal on the bottom of each ear cups which compromise noise cancelling and let's quite a bit if ambient sound in.The cups are also surprisingly hard on the ear cartilage since it rest on them too much.Sound is incredible!

I've owned lots of headphones, Bose and otherwise.I use them for hours a day, everyday.They get dropped, jerked around, subjected to all kinds of stress.None has stood up like these B&O headphones.I've had these for almost two years now and not a single issue.The BOSE noise-cancelling headphones I has previously broke after a year.These may seem expensive, but you are getting what you pay for.The only possible alternative may be the Bowers & Wilkins.But, whatever you do, never choose the Sony headphones.Despite being Japanese, the build quality just isn't there.

I bought the HX directly from B&O, not from Amazon, hoping it would mitigate the risk of the touch control issue experienced by many according to Amazon's comment section. It didn't help. I can't tap, swipe, or spin it.Upgrading the software puts the headphones in limbo: I can't turn it off and I can't connect either. Had to factory reset.The power button (and the mode switch button) is much more easily triggered than on H9i, which is bad is my opinion.The sound, comfort, and noise cancelling are actually better than H9i if you trust me, but the robustness is beyond disappointing.

I’ve been a Bang & Olufsen loyalist for years. I own a number of their audio products. The issue I’m having is with their new H9 replacement, Beoplay HX. The touch control is non-responsive to volume control. I’ve owned every generation of the H9 line, RMA’d an H9 3rd Gen previous to the HX, with a defective Bluetooth module.I bought the Beoplay HX days after its release. The unit arrived 5 days from the date of purchase. I was rather disappointed it arrived defective, especially after a previous RMA on an H9 3rd Gen. barely 2 months ago. Also, the noise cancellation doesn't even match the H9, there's leakage into the headphones from the surroundings, or the technology has been degraded in this model. At this rate, quality control is rather concerning compared to previous models. I want to purchase the E8 3rd Gen Sport for the gym but I have decided to hold off, or maybe go with something like Sennheiser or Bose.To put my hardware engineering hat on, in my opinion, the circular swipe design lends itself to problems because of the large capacitive touch area. They call it intuitive but it just doesn’t work as reasonably expected. It’s not flawless like Bose’s even on a good unit. This is my biggest knock on most modern B&O headphones with this volume control mechanism. I’m not sure why B&O insists on these awkward mechanics. I believe Bose is fairly successful in this area because their capacitive swipe is quite smooth and fairly accurate (I’ve owned all models of Bose headphones as well). On the Bose NC 700, to increase the volume, hold and swipe up. To decrease the volume, hold and swipe down. This in my opinion is more intuitive.The HX was the first purchase from the B&O website, I’ve made other purchases on Amazon and their boutique stores around the world. Obtaining an RMA on the online purchase was not an issue, it was a fairly easy process. I take issue with the non-sensical return process. After shelling $500 for a pair of headphones that arrived defective to no fault of mine, I don’t want to wait for another 40 to 50 days to get my hands on another pair. The 30 days free return on the website is misleading at best. It’s really lacking in details to account for this long return process. You don’t get a refund for another 2 to 3 weeks after they receive the defective unit. No matter if it’s the 30 days free return advertised on their website or return for replacement, the return shipping label from the company, in either case, is UPS ground, which could take up to a week to reach their warehouse. Adding to the 2 to 3 weeks RMA return process I mentioned, when all said and done, expect the return and refund process to take a month before you see your money. If you plan to re-purchase another unit, adds another 4 days to 5 days to received the unit. Expect 5 weeks to enjoy your Beoplay HX if you receive a defective unit. I can successfully RMA a Bose product and have my money back in less than a week. The big question becomes, why wait this long if returns are free as advertised? Logic dictates one should get a refund when they receive the unit and verify contents, a process that shouldn’t take more than 48 hours to be charitable. In my opinion, they should add the language “Allow 4 to 6 weeks for free return or RMA,” to be accurate.Alternatively, you can fork more cash to purchase another unit with the hope you will get a refund on the defective unit; that’s a $1,000 opportunity cost to you and cash-at-hand for B&O. If this sounds like a Ponzi scheme, that is my concern. And the story doesn’t end there. The surprise came when I tried to air my concerns to a supervisor or manager. They don’t exist… Similar to the Chinese model of customer service, the support staff you speak to on the phone is the end of the line. They don’t even have anyone to call you back. Per the support team call line, supervisors or managers don’t exist. If support can’t address your issue, you’re SOL!… If I’m purchasing a premium pair of headphones, I expect commensurate customer service. Companies selling $50 headphones have supervisors who can address concerns beyond the support staff level. This is the reason I referred to this manner of doing business as akin to a Ponzi Scheme—everything about the B&O decision-making chain is opaque. This business model appears to be ""TRUST US"", like the majority of Chinese manufacturers. Trust comes with transparency. If you don’t have a front-facing supervisory staff and want to sell consumers, then this is a major problem. Most consumers like to know concerns are being addressed by management should the need arise to escalate an issue. B&O generally makes good products but my online experience has been an eye-opener. In my opinion, they need to be more responsive to customers' concerns, especially if one is to spend a premium on their headphones. I’m not sure they appreciate there is a healthy level of competition with many reputable electronic makers coming on board to get a piece of this rapidly growing pie.From my experience, Bose is a level above the rest when it comes to their RMA process. Even though the return is ground, your exchange is ready to go as soon as UPS scans the return. You can receive an exchange for a defective unit in as little as 3 days from the time you request an RMA. Depending on how fast you need your headphones, shipping on the replacement unit can be upgraded as a courtesy to UPS 2nd Day Air. Compare that with 5 to 6 weeks for B&O. Plus, you can escalate your concerns to the level you wish, they are available to address your concerns. If they make a mistake with their order process, you get a free upgrade or sometimes free headphones. Bose has the best customer service experience in my book when it comes to consumer headphones. That’s what I expect from a premium headphone maker.UPDATE: 4-22-21 - Thoughts After Purchasing the 2nd Headset in Lieu of Waiting For RMA Process to Complete:I went with my option B and bought another pair of headphones while waiting for the previous set to get RMA'd for a full refund hopefully. The problem I stated, with my first headsets--non-responsive volume control swipe--still persists. In my opinion, this is most likely a hardware flaw or a bad production batch. You can't have two different headsets bought at different time periods exhibiting the exact same problem. I'm comparing it to the smooth mechanics of the Beoplay H9 series. I found however that if you press on the control area with a moderate-to-high amount of pressure, it works somewhat, but is far from accurate, or even an ideal solution. This is something Bang & Olufsen engineers may have to address. I'm not sure if this can be done through a firmware update. If it's adjusting sensitivity, this can be done... I like the headphones, the earcups are slighting larger, the sound signature is what you expect from B&O, and the carrying case is finally commensurate with premium headphones. But I'm disappointed with the ANC. It is not as good as the H9, which was not as effective as say Bose NC 700. I will keep them for the 30-day grace period and see if I can live with this big inconvenience if no proposed hardware remedies. If anything changes, I will be sure to provide an update.UPDATE: 4-24-21: Battery LifeWOW!!!... The battery life on these headphones is truly amazing, I just had to share this update.I decided to put together my Summer tracks. I couldn't believe the battery life on these headphones. They last over 48 hours of continuous heavy music listening, with ANC on, at about 80% volume, and still had 20% battery remaining!! I haven't experienced any premium headphones out there with such juice.  You have to move into custom $1,000 plus headphones. Battery life is truly phenomenal, better than advertised in this experience!! Bose NC 700 are ready to quit after less than 24 hours of continuous listening with ANC on. Sony MX1000's go a little longer but nothing compared to the B&O HXs. This is a big positive if you travel frequently.

I bought these knowing I could return them as I was wary of the price.  I have a lot of headphones Sony XM3s, Sennheishre HD600s, Bose QC30s, Senn MTW, etc.  I have to say these are excellent.  Comfort is exemplary - you truly do forget you have them on.  Sound is superb.  Better than Sony's significantly.  Sony's can sound muddy.  Connectivity is finicky at first and almost a deal breaker.  I updated them and also used them for a few days and somehow it sorted itself out.  They always repair with my phone and laptop with a rare issue.  Controls are ok - take some getting used to but work (mostly).  NC is just ok.  I didn't buy these for NC, but can say for sure not as good as Sony's or Bose - but that is expected.  Overall, build quality, sound quality and comfort make these a good purchase imo.

If you like the B&O sound you'll love these. I slightly boosted the bass in the EQ to get the sound I wanted, but they're super crisp and clear. The noise cancelling is decent, better than I was expecting from reviews, but I don't think they'd be great for air travel.My biggest issue is that the Timber marketing photos are completely inaccurate - the leather is bright, almost orange, and not very natural looking. It makes them look cheap. I think I'll be exchanging for a different color.

I’ve been wanting to try Bang & Olufsen headphones for sometime but the H95’s were just too much $$$ for me to justify the expense. However the newer HX’s were a $100 off their regular price so I decided now was the time to try them. I have tried numerous wireless noise canceling headphones over the last year and really liked a number of them but none were exactly right for one reason or another. I tried Sennheiser Momentum 3’s, Bowers & Wilkins PX7’s, Master and Dynamics MW65’s, Shure Aionic 50’s and still own the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and the AirPods Max. In my opinion the Bang & Olufsen HX’s are the best of the lot, overall, but aren’t perfect by any means but are very close. Longer battery life, excellent sound especially when tweaked with the equalizer in the Bang & Olufsen app and are super comfortable for extended wear. Noise cancelling is very good, not Sony level but close. To my ears sound better than the AirPods Max and so much lighter and more comfortable. One note on comfort is yes, the round ear cups are smaller then the rectanglular shape of the AirPods Max and will probably sit a little on your ears as they do mine, however the leather covered memory foam ear pads combined with the light but stable clamping force of these headphones make it a non issue. After 3+ hours of wear I was only minimally aware of them, they are that comfortable. They have a wear detection feature but I found even on the reduced setting it would pause music with the slightest turn of my head so I turned it off. I read longer hair (I do need a hair cut) can cause issues and a recalibration can fix it but it’s not that important to me at this time. As for the only other issue that will bother some is the touch controls are finicky for sure, the play, pause and swipe to change tracks works fine but the volume swipe around the cup is very difficult to get to work, at least for me it has been, but still not that big of a deal to me. I love the sand color with the gold accented aluminum finish on the cups which is eye-catching for sure. Only had them for less than 24 hours so can’t really speak about battery life as of yet but seems to be on par with what Bang & Olufsen claim. Sound quality is top-notch with a well balanced sound the you can adjust in the app to what you like. Bass is precise and pleasant, especially on the warmer side of the eq but not overpowering like some. It hits the sweet spot for me. Over-all these are my favorite headphones yet and I highly recommend them especially at the Black Friday prices! I may update later as I use them more and after I use them outside of the apartment. I’m a headphone addict I guess and I love these headphones!11/28/21 Update. The wear sensors work great as long as you calibrate them first: have the headphones on a flat surface, turn them on, turn in the wear sensors and then put them on. Once calibrated they work perfectly. I do recommend the “reduced sensitivity “ setting. Also the volume slider works fine as long as you are swiping in the right spot inside the ring on the right ear cup. Battery life is as advertised! Love them!Update 12/16/21: Sadly, I decided to return these headphones for a couple of reasons: noise cancelling was not very strong and didn’t really block out much noise (especially on the bus commuting to work). The wear sensors worked when calibrated every time you turn on the headphones but when I had them connected to both my iPhone and iPad Pro they would always auto play music from my iPad no matter what I had been listening to prior to turning them on/off. Also the sound was very finicky, they sounded great for instrumental and jazz but other genres weren’t as great with either sharp highs or the bass would distort at higher volumes (even after the software update was supposed to fix this issue). I was constantly having to adjust the EQ to find a good sound that wouldn’t sound great across all songs. I really wanted to love them because of the premium design, materials and good looks, but in the end decided they weren’t worth the high price. Went back to the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and am happy with my decision (strong sound and excellent noise cancellation).Update Again, 2/16/22. After purchasing and liking Shure’s Aonic 40 headphones, but not satisfied with their build quality, I couldn’t resist purchasing the B & O Beoplay HX (this time in Black Anthracite) again and I’m so happy I did. (What was I thinking returning them?) the build quality is first rate, super comfortable (despite the round ear cups which do sit on my ears a bit, but are soft and really comfortable even for long periods) and the sound quality is the best over all that I’ve tested. I wasn’t impressed the first time with the noise cancellation but upon this second listen realize it is better than I gave it credit for and slightly better than than the noise cancellation on the Shure’s. Once you find the right spot on the unusual eq in the app the sound is kind of unparalleled. The only issues I have found is the wear sensors don’t always work so I turned them off, and the multi-point connection causes some unwanted functions like automatically playing from my iPad Pro even if I was listening on my iPhone last time they were connected. (Auto play not an issue with the sensors turned off anyway). Also, the touch controls are finicky but I’ve found most are.  Not deal breakers for me. I revised my rating and now highly recommend the HX, particularly at a discounted price (they are pricey, but you get what you pay for, as they say!)

 ATTENZIONE!!! ATTENZIONE!!! ATTENZIONE!!!  AGGIORNAMENTO RISOLUTIVO Ver. 2.0.1Oggi 30.10.2021, come faccio periodicamente con i prodotti che recensisco in modo particolarmente negativo, tendo a rianalizzarli per verificare eventuali interventi risolutivi da parte delle Aziende produttrici.  Oggi è toccato alla cuffia Bang&Olufsen HX, e a conferma del fatto che ciò che ho cercato di dimostrare nel video che trovate in allegato e descritto in recensione corrispondeva a verità, mi sono ritrovato un aggiornamento in Applicazione da parte dell'azienda B&O  dove è riportato il difetto di distorsione di cui parlavo. Circa un ora fa ho proceduto all'aggiornamento firmware  Ver.2.0.1 e ho riverificato con la mia solita scrupolosità la cuffia. Posso affermare con estrema soddisfazione e facendo i complimenti alla Bang&Olufsen che il problema è stato risolto completamente. Adesso si che riesco ad apprezzarla pienamente e confermare il fatto che si tratta di una cuffia premium di elevatissima qualità generale.ATTENZIONE !!  TUTTO QUELLO CHE LEGGERETE DA QUI IN POI E' LA RECENSIONE CHE PUBBLICAI IL GIORNO 09.04.2021. ANCHE IL VIDEO DIMOSTRATIVO RACCONTA IL DIFETTO CHE ADESSO NON E' PIU' PRESENTE, ADESSO SUONA IN MODO MERAVIGLIOSO!RECENSIONE CUFFIA BLUETOOTH BANG & OLUFSEN BEOPLAY HX- PICCOLA PREMESSANutro la passione per l'ascolto della musica fin da quando ero bambino. Ho posseduto e provato nel corso della mia vita le più svariate tipologie di cuffie, cablate, wireless, da gaming, IN-EAR, OVER Ear e chi più ne ha più ne metta.Possiedo e ascolto cuffie del calibro di Marshall, Yamaha, Sennheiser Sony, Jabra, e le vario a seconda della tipologia di genere musicale che in quel momento mi va di ascoltare.Dico fin da subito che al momento la cuffia bluetooth OVER-EAR che preferisco in assoluto è la Sony WH-1000XM4 che utilizzo con estrema soddisfazione quasi tutti i giorni. Sarà quindi inevitabile qualche confronto diretto con le BEOPLAY HX.INIZIO A RACCONTARE QUELLA CHE E' STATA LA MIA DELUDENTE ESPERIENZANon ho mai avuto fino a questo momento la possibilità di provare una cuffia del prestigioso brand B&O e avendo avuto questa occasione, ero particolarmente euforico, per cui anche le aspettative erano estremamente elevate.Non appena mi è arrivata ho installato l'applicazione della B&O sul mio Iphone X per l'accoppiamento. Fatto ciò, l'applicazione mi ha indicato la presenza di un firmware più aggiornato e prima di iniziare ad utilizzare la cuffia l'ho aggiornata alla versione 1.2.9.L'ho indossata ed ho iniziato ad ascoltare per una mezzoretta generi pop, jazz e leggera mantenendo il volume della cuffia a non più del 50%. La pulizia, la chiarezza, la precisione dai bassi e la brillantezza degli alti mi ha immediatamente rapito! Un suono davvero fantastico, un livello di dettaglio e fedeltà a dir poco disarmante. Davvero meravigliose è stata la prima cosa che ho pensato.Dopo la prima oretta di ascolto ""SOFT"" ho iniziato a spingermi oltre il 50% di volume per valutare il livello di massima pressione sonora. Che dire, fantastico anche questo....mah,,,, iniziavo a percepire qualcosa che non mi convinceva.Quando ero i al 100% del volume, apprezzavo su alcuni brani un qualcosa che non riuscivo a focalizzare bene, tipo uno scoppiettio, un gracchio, una distorsione... un qualcosa che saltuariamente veniva fuori su delle variazioni soprattutto dei bassi e sugli alti all'interno dei brani.Non ho dato tanta importanza a questa ""cosa poco chiara"" e ho proseguito con lo studio della cuffia e della sua applicazione. Ho apprezzato all'interno dell'applicazione la presenza di un equalizzatore con Preset e personalizzabile ed ho iniziato a colorare maggiormente le basse e le alte frequenze. Improvvisamente ho iniziato ad avvertire quel ""rumore poco chiaro"" di cui vi parlavo prima,  in modo decisamente più forte, fastidioso e incomprensibile. Sembravano delle scariche improvvise sui driver estremamente fastidiose e preoccupanti. Non vi nascondo che ho iniziato a pensare ad una inspiegabile rottura della cuffia. Quindi ho iniziato a fare tantissime prove. L'ho collegata in streaming AAC su Iphone, successivamente l'ho collegata in Aptx su uno smartphone Android per poi passare al collegamento cablato attraverso il jack da 3,5 mm e il DIFETTO ENORME ERA SEMPRE PRESENTE.Dopo tante prove ero giunto alla conclusione che con molta probabilità avevo ricevuto uno sfortunato campione guasto. Considerata l'importanza ed il peso negativo che avrebbe avuto la mia recensione su questo prodotto, ho voluto approfondire la questione acquistando da Amazon la stessa cuffia per fare una comparativa con quella ricevuta tramite programma Vine. Senza allungarmi troppo, sono rimasto di stucco quando ho constatato lo stesso e identico difetto anche sulla seconda cuffia.HO INIZIATO A PENSARE CHE STESSI SBAGLIANDO IO QUALCOSA, anche perchè leggevo sul web altri recensori che non lamentavano lo stesso problema. Fortunatamente mi sono accorto che l'aveva appena recensita POSITIVAMENTE uno youtuber italiano che stimo tantissimo. Ovviamente gli ho scritto subito nei commenti chiedendo se lui aveva notato lo stesso problema. La prima volta mi ha risposto di no, ma quando gli ho scritto di provare la cuffia al massimo volume e spostandosi manualmente con l'equalizzatore mi ha confermato che riscontrava lo stesso problema.Nonostante avessi avuto la prima conferma dallo Youtuber, non mi sono fermato qui. Infatti ho contattato un rivenditore B&O presente nella mia zona spiegando il problema che stavo riscontrando. Il rivenditore si è reso subito disponibile e non credeva a quello che gli stavo raccontando. Mi ha detto che aveva appena ricevuto un campione di questa cuffia in negozio e che potevamo analizzare la cosa. Così è stato, Il gentilissimo signore ha installato e aggiornato la sua Beoplay HX sul suo smartphone Android  ed ha constatato SBALORDITO l'effettiva problematica di cui vi ho parlato. Ovviamente per spiegare al meglio a chi sta leggendo questa recensione il problema, ho fatto un video in cui vi mostro il difetto sulla mia B&O HX. Tenete presente però che siamo a 4 cuffie su 4 con lo stesso problema, fate un pò voi..PARLIAMO UN PO' DEGLI ALTRI ASPETTI DI QUESTA CUFFIAIL DESIGN l'ho trovato davvero fantastico, un attenzione ai dettagli minimale. Materiali come alluminio e vera pelle rendono questa cuffia estremamente elegante e raffinata a livello estetico.ANCHE RISPETTO ALLA COMODITA' c'è poco di cui potersi lamentare, l'ho trovata estremamente comoda, stringe il giusto, non pesa molto (285g) ed è piuttosto compatta e non invadente sul capo.L'AUTONOMIA è OTTIMA considerando che può suonare per circa 40 ore senza ANC e circa 35 ore con ANC attiva.L'APPLICAZIONE se paragonata a quella disponibile per la cuffia Sony MX4 è decisamente più ""ESSENZIALE"". Si può solo controllare l'equalizzazione ( abbiamo ascoltato in che modo!! ). Si può controllare il livello di cancellazione del rumore e impostare altre due cosette come il tempo di standby prima dell'autospegnimento e attivare/disattivare la funzione di autoplay e pausa quando togliamo la cuffia da capo, nulla in più.LA CANCELLAZIONE ATTIVA DEL RUMORE, unita a quella passiva è da apprezzare. A parer mio funziona molto bene e riesce ad abbattere di molto i rumori esterni. Anche in questo comparto la cuffia di Sony fa un pelino meglio ma in questo comparto la B&O mi ha convinto positivamente.MANCA UNA GUIDA VOCALE e abituato alla Sony MX4 dove è presente, avverto molto la mancanza nell'utilizzo della cancellazione del rumore ad esempio. Quando sulla B&O attivo tramite il pulsante la cancellazione del rumore o la disattivo, avverto solo dei toni difficili da interpretare. Se poi stiamo ascoltando della musica questi toni non si avvertono assolutamente, anche perchè vengono riprodotti lasciando la musica al massimo volume. Sulla cuffia di Sony, quando si attiva L'ANC la guida vocale lo segnala riducendo momentaneamente la musica per poi farla riprendere morbidamente.ALTRA COSA SCOMODA RISPETTO alla MX4 di Sony è che se mi si avvicina una persona che mi sta parlando mentre ascolto musica, sono costretto o a togliere la cuffia dalla testa per poterci parlare. In alternativa dovrei mettere in pausa la musica con un tap sul padiglione DX e premere il pulsante sul padiglione SX per disattivare l'ANC e impostare la modalita' trasparenza. Sulla MX4 di Sony, mentre ascolto musica posso poggiare la mano sul padiglione e la cuffia attiverà immediatamente la modalità trasparenza riducendo la musica. Tolta la mano la musica risalirà in modo soft e si riattiverà L'ANC ( se attivato in precedenza).UN'ALTRA COSA PER CUI PREFERISCO la mx4 di Sony è in fatto che la cuffia è pieghevole, per cui una volta chiusa occupa pochissimo spazio riducendo abbondantemente la dimensione della custodia necessaria per il trasporto.LE MIE PERSONALI CONSIDERAZIONI IN CONCLUSIONEPer me non è mai un piacere trovarmi a dover penalizzare un prodotto con il mio giudizio. Capisco bene e mi rendo conto che dietro ad ogni prodotto c'è gente che lavora e si impegna. Purtroppo in questo caso non posso fare diversamente. Una cuffia che è arrivata da me con aspettative altissime e che ha saputo darmi parecchia delusione.Tengo a sottolineare che se utilizzate la cuffia al 60% del volume, anche enfatizzando gli alti o i bassi con l'equalizzatore, il problema non si presenta e la cuffia offre un suono davvero eccezionale.I problemi (a parer mio davvero molto gravi) vengono fuori quando si inizia ad andare oltre il 60/70% del volume. Siete disposti a spendere circa 500,00 Euro al 07.04.2021 per una cuffia con questi limiti e caratteristiche generali? A voi la scelta.Sono abbastanza sicuro che la maggior parte dei lettori, leggendo la mia recensione penserà che ho sbagliato io qualcosa e che non possibile che la Beoplay HX soffra della problematica descritta. Sono altrettanto convito però, che se deciderete di acquistarla, dopo un minuto di utilizzo ripenserete alla mia recensione.Sperando di esservi stato di aiuto con la mia esperienza a riguardo di questa Bang&Olufsen Beoplay HX, ne approfitto per salutare.

Me encantan estos auriculares:en cuanto a su construcción, elección y selección materiales empleados, así como su mecanizado y ajuste, tengo que decir que estoy muuuy satisfecho, ni la más mínima holgura, marca, rebaba, ruido , nada de cada, calidad de materiales y calidad de construcción por totas partes, destila calidad y exclusividad, un 10 sin duda alguna.son muy cómodos, se sientes claramente más que los Bose que acabo de jubilar, pero sin embargo se sujetan algo mejor y no fatigan tanto con el paso de las horas.respecto al sonido , los uso casi por completo para ver cine, Netflix , series...etc , por lo que no me interesan auriculares con ""color del sonido""  sino que quiero un sonido neutro y fiel al original ,  sin procesado o tendencia a resaltar una frecuencias sobre las otras como es el caso de Sony ( probé el harchirecomendado SONY WH100XM4 que es un fantástico auricular pero más orientado a música e incluso más hacia unos géneros musicales concretos) , el sonido del estos B&O es especialmente nítido y preciso, se distinguen con precisión los distintos sonidos tanto en canal como frecuencias y la experiencia envolvente es bastante convincente, mis viejos Bose aunque muy buenos en este sentido se quedan 2 pasos por detrás justificando en mi caso la inversión que supone el cambio de auriculares.solo los uso en casa por lo que las funciones de cancelación de sonido no las uso salvo el modo transparente que no conocía y me está resultando útil.como crítica constructiva diría que el sistema táctil de control de volumen o pausa/ playa no es tan ágil como otras opciones, la casi ausencia de botones mejora la estética ligera y elegante eso sí.la caja de trasporte es de calidad y robusta, nada que ver con los trapos o bolsas con velcro de otros auriculares que también tienen un precio elevado.el emparejamiento es muy rápidolos amantes de los graves bien presentes deberían de optar por otros fabricantes, los graves en estos B&O estar están ... pero no más que medios o agudos.estos B&O  cuestan un dinero.. pero ademas de costarlo tambien lo valen, el valor se ve, se toca y se escucha, se ajusta perfectamente a mis necesidades de uso sin duda.como escribi al empezar... me encantan estos  auriculares.

Reçu ce jour et essayé de suite.Ce qui frappe immédiatement c’est la qualité de finition et les matériaux utilisés, là on peut dire qu’on en a pour son argent!Le son est cristallin mais on peut le retoucher grâce à l’equalizer de l’application (qui est très bien faite) si vous sentez le besoin d’avoir quelque chose de différent.Ce son est assez extraordinaire, au niveau des Shure ou B&W que je connais bien, cela va ceci dit un peu dans tous les sens avec les sons saturés (mais je recherche la petite bête)Très bon achat

Bueno, después ya de uno días con ellos y probando diferentes usos voy a dar mi opinión.La fabricación es excelente, el diseño es cuestión de gustos, pero para mi son de los más bonitos, también son muy cómodos, te traen una funda de viaje rígida que está bastante bien, pensaba comprar una ya que yo estos los usos para cuando voy de viaje, así que eso me ahorro.👍Detalles tecnicos, la conexión con mi teléfono ( iPhone) rápida y fácil, la app de B&O está bien, me parece completa. Los controles táctiles no son de los de mejor respuesta, los botones físicos si van bien, la cancelación de ruido no es la mejor que yo he probado ni de lejos, en mi caso predomina la firma de sonido a esta función pero si para ti es muy importante creo tienes mejores opciones.Pasemos a lo más importante, el Sonido; definido, “suave”, frecuencias altas claras, sin ser demasiado brillantes pero bien detalladas, medios, excelentes lo tiene casi todo, detallados,las texturas perfectamente definidas, amplias, las frecuencias bajas, he visto opiniones que dicen les falta bajos, en mi opinión no, creo son correctos además los puedes ecualizar desde su propia app asi que no, están bien, es verdad que no son para Bass Heads, pero es que no lo pretenden, son para todo tipo de musica, yo personalmente escucho de todo, así que como la app permite ecualizar y guardar diferentes tipos yo los tengo guardados y los uso para cada tipo de música género.En fin, que creo son muy buena compra, si además les hacéis seguimiento y los podéis conseguir con alguna promoción como hice yo creo os satisfarán bastante. Saludos!

Nichts ist so schwer, wie die Beurteilung eines kopfhörer's. Wenn es nach mir geht.Denn es gibt kaum eine Kategorie, wo die Meinungen weiter auseinander gehen wie beim Thema Klang. Was genau definiert einen guten Klang? Das kann man so einfach nicht beurteilen, da die Geschmäcker und Vorlieben da sehr sehr weit auseinander gehen. Ein Bild von einem Fernseher kann man gut und einfach beurteilen. Aber nicht den Klang.Meine Reise, bei der ich auf der Suche nach einem Kopfhörer bin geht nun ca. 3 Jahre. Wie viele andere auch, habe ich die ersten Kopfhörer anhand von Rezensionen gekauft, ausprobiert, zurück geschickt oder wieder verkauft. Schließlich habe ich mich eine Zeit lang für ein Modell entschieden, aber eher aus Frust als das ich wirklich Zufrieden damit war.Meine Anforderungen waren folgende, der Wichtigkeit nach sortiert:- Kräftiger, trotzdem dezenter Bass, besonders tief und auch wahrnehmbar bei leisen Lautstärken. Ich will nicht dazu gezwungen werden bei einem Lied, welches mir aufgrund des Bass gefällt, den Lautsprecher lauter zu machen, damit ich etwas vom Bass mitbekomme.- Dann gibt es noch den Bass, der so present ist (was zwar Geil ist), wo man aber nach einer Stunde Kopfschmerzen bekommt, weil es in Bereichen doch zu viel ist und die Ausgewogenheit fehlt. Am besten kann ich es bei Szenen beschreiben, wo ich den Kopfhörer nutze um Filme zu schauen. Da gibt es kurze Szenen bei dem ordentlich was los ist, und dann gibt es auch Szenen, wo die Packung an Action doch etwas länger geht und der Kopfhörer dann unangenehm wird, weil der Bass zu intensiv ist. Das sind dann die Momente, wo man freiwillig etwas leiser macht, und nach der Actionszene dann wieder lauter. Vielleicht versteht ihr was ich meine.- Der Kopfhörer muss Musik und Filme wiedergeben können. Hier scheitert es bei den meisten Kopfhörern- Der übrige Klang sollte so klar und detailreich wie möglich sein. Ich liebe Höhen, wenn sie klar sind und hasse Mitteltöne wenn sie zu betont sind.- Und zu guter letzt, sollte der Kopfhörer angenehm zu tragen sein. Auf dem Schädel, Ohren, und längere Sitzungen aushalten ohne Schweißgebatete Ohren zu bekommen.- ANC und Transparenz Modi kommen ganz zum schluss!Auf meiner Reise habe ich nun folgende Modelle durch:- Bose QC 35. Trifft meinen Geschmack überhaupt nicht. Lässt sich nicht nach meinen belieben anpassen- Sony WH 3000, tolle Höhen und mitten, gut abgestimmt. Aber der Bass kommt viel zu kurz.- Sennheiser RS 175, Super zum Filme schauen, aber bei Musik stößt er zu oft an seine Grenzen- Sennheiser Momentum, kommt dem Bang Olufsen HX schon sehr nahe. Unterschiede gibt es nur in Nuancen.Das sind die Kopfhörer, die es geschafft haben, wenigstens eine längere Test phase bei mir zu bleiben. Alle anderen Spare ich mir aufzuzählen, da sie direkt nach den ersten 10 Minuten wieder in den Karton gewandert sind.Und nun bekommt ihr meine Erfahrung, mit den Bang Olufsen HX!Karton und Verpackung, alles schön. Interessiert keine Sau! Die Kopfhörer selbst, perfekt verarbeitet, so wie es sich in dieser Preiskategorie gehört! Das erste Einrichten erfordert die Installation einer App, danach kann es los gehen mit koppeln usw. und sofort!Jetzt muss ich sagen, das ich die Kopfhörer nach der ersten Inbetriebnahme und nach den ersten 10 Minuten, beinahe wieder in den Karton gelegt hätte. Denn die Voreingestellten Klangmodis sind allesamt einfach nur schrecklich. Wie bereits erwähnt, ich hasse es wenn Mitteltöne zu betont sind. Und genau das ist hier er Fall gewesen.Dann habe ich aber Glücklicherweise den Button ""Custom"" entdeckt, wo man einen Punkt in einem Kreis hin und herschieben kann und sich die Tonlage entsprechend verändert. Mehr Bass, mehr Wärme, mehr Höhen usw. Man kann hier ziemlich gut den eigenen Geschmack auskunden ohne dabei ein Profi sein zu müssen.Nach einer halben Stunde habe ich mir dann 2 eigene Profile angelegt, die es in die weitere Test phase geschafft haben. Und nun, nach einer Woche Intensiver Nutzung ist die Entscheidung gefallen. DAS SIND DIE BESTEN KOPFHÖRER, DIE ICH JE HATTE!!!Die Klangqualität ist herausragend. Der Bass ist present, ohne aufdringlich zu werden. Höhen sind klar und extrem detailreich, ohne Schrill zu werden. Man hört Details heraus, die man vorher noch nie wahrgenommen hat. Egal ob ich Leise oder etwas lauter höre, egal ob Film oder Musik. Ein Segen in jeder hinsicht.In den letzten Tagen habe ich die Kopfhörer teilweise 10 Stunden am Stück auf gehabt, was dank des Transparenz Modus kein Problem war.Ich konnte mich in Ruhe mit meiner Frau unterhalten und dabei im Hintergrund Musik hören. Als es mir dann zu viel wurde, habe ich den ANC Modus aktiviert und ich war Glücklich. Einfach immer mit dem Kopf nicken, dann ist alles gut. Die Kopfhörer sitzen schließlich sehr Sicher. Zumindest auf meiner Birne. Ich finde, jeder Mann braucht einen ANC Kopfhörer.Spaß beiseite, was ich damit sagen will. Sie sind unfassbar bequem. Als hätte Bang Olufsen meinen Schädel als Muster genommen und den Kopfhörer drumherum gebaut. Ich setze den Kopfhörer manchmal Vormittags auf, höre Musik und lasse den Tag mit 1-2 Filmen bis in die Nacht ausklingen. Kein Problem, keine verschwitzen Ohren, keine Druckstellen. Man vergisst schnell, daß man sie trägt. Besser kann ich es mir nicht vorstellen.Es mag sein, daß das ANC bei anderen Kopfhörern besser funktioniert. Das ist für mich persönlich nicht schlimm, da es der wenigste Grund für diese Kopfhörer ist.Die Laufzeit ist unglaublich gut. Ein mal in der Woche laden bei sehr intensiver Nutzung reicht voll aus.Habe ich auch noch was zu bemängeln?Jein. Ich hätte mir gewünscht, daß die Ohrmuscheln einen tacken größer oder Oval währen. Mein Ohr passt gerade so hinein. Für mich ist das noch ok, aber ich glaube es gibt Menschen, die noch etwas größere Ohren haben. Für die wird es komisch.Ich kann euch nur empfehlen, besorgt euch den Bang Olufsen, gibt ihm eine Chance, legt euch ein oder mehrere eigene Profile an. Testet ihn und probiert danach meinet wegen den Kopfhörer aus, den ihr vorher hattet.Denn ich selbst habe nun das Problem, das ich seid dem Bang Olufsen HX meine IN Ears nicht mehr mag, weil sie schlechter klingen =) Die fand ich vorher übrigens richtig gut.Von mir, vollste Empfehlung !!!

→La qualité de fabrication est au rdv.→ ANC ne fonctionne pas et le SON en Mode neutre est digne des écouteurs à 10€ (lol). c'est une honte.→ l'application vous permet de corriger le SON mais Si non, la musique sera très très métalliques et sera en manque de spacialisation.Également un manque de définition.Une fois les réglages sur EQ de l' application réalisé, une toucher plus à rien.• VERDICT :UNE ARNAQUE SI VOUS L' AVEZ ACHAT AU PRIX FORT.• NOTE :Les Bang and Olufsen model : EQ, sont bien meilleur sur la qualité sonore et ANC mais pas sur les commandes tactiles.• Passer votre chemin Pour autre chose car à 500€, c'est Chère payé pour une expérience sonore bas de gamme.Bizarre 😒Cordialement.

Mes casques précédents sont sans réduction active du bruit, mais avec une qualité sonore au top... je vais donc essayer de faire un commentaire utile pour ceux qui achètent pour la première fois un casque avec ANC, car je ne peux pas comparer l'efficacité du Beoplay HX avec d'autres solutions existantes.Donc je commence par une précision importante, malgré les commentaires parfois élogieux ou dithyrambique sur l'ANC, évitons de vendre du rêve, cela réduit le bruit environnant mais il n'y a pas de miracle. Pour les porteurs de lunettes, cela peut même être carrément décevant (présence de fuite de son au niveau des branches). De plus, l'ANC produit une sorte de pression acoustique pouvant occasionner une sensation désagréable, une sorte de tension permanente... bref n'oublions pas qu'un bon casque passif avec des écouteurs bien isolés peut répondre parfaitement au besoin (et bien mieux qu'une ANC avec une piètre isolation du casque !!!)... donc n'achetez de casque ANC que pour un usage où il est réellement utile (transports en commun). Pour le reste, pensez au passif (et la batterie vous remerciera).Ensuite, sur les qualités du Beoplay HX, je souligne la bonne facture et surtout les matériaux utilisés (cuir véritable pour les coussinets ! très peu de casques en proposent). C'est ce qui me fait aimer (et garder) ce casque. Le son est de bonne qualité mais rien de sensationnel, un peu neutre, je ne vois pas beaucoup d'intérêt à la sorte d'equalizer fourni avec l'application.D'ailleurs la gestion du son me laisse un avis mitigé, pas assez graduelle (on bascule vite dans le trop fort, et les marches d'augmentation du son sont trop marquées, j'aurais préféré quelque chose de plus progressif).Une véritable fausse note sur le pilotage tactile du casque, une vraie catastrophe (voir les autres commentaires... ce n'est pas exagéré, le casque est franchement raté de ce point de vue, à croire que personne ne l'a testé avant la commercialisation !)Alors je mets 4 étoiles parce que j'y ai quand même mis le prix (et ça me fait mal au coeur de contredire un choix que j'ai fait en lisant ici et là les différents tests...) mais honnêtement je pense que cela ne vaut pas plus que la moitié de son prix...

 Nachdem ich nach einigem Testen um die Weihnachtszeit zu meinen phänomenalen Beyerdynamic DT 1770 gekommen bin, dachte ich das diese auch auf Reisen und abseits der Heimat die richtige Wahl sind. Aber Kabel und auch die Transportgrösse, haben mich leidereines anderen belehrt.Also doch Blauzahn mit ANC und klapp- oder faltbar mit geringem Packmass und exzellenter Klangqualität. Dazu noch ausdauernd und von fühlbar guter Qualität.Das kann schwierig werden…Die Beyerdynamic Lagoon fielen schon zur Weihnachtszeit raus - kein Bassfundament, ANC mit starken Nebengeräuschen…Die Sennheiser Momentum waren da schon eine andere Qualität. Luftig und mit kräftigem Bass. Aber Soundstage und vor allem das Soundimaging ließen neben meinen DT 1770 doch deutlich zu wünschen übrig.Beats ist Bassgewummer (sorry)Und Sony habe zwar tolles ANC aber der Rest ist nicht mein Geschmack.Nun sind diese Höreindrücke immer subjektiv. Ich höre gerne auch analytisch. Ich liebe es bei Jazzaufnahmen die Instrumente einzeln herausgearbeitet auf der Bühne zu erleben. Ein elektrischer Bass muss schnell, knackig und trocken kommen und vom warmen und weichen akustischen Bass unterscheidbar sein.Stimmen sollen mich berühren - nicht anschreien oder gar zischeln.Diana Krall ist ein Beispiel für hervorragende Aufnahmequalität, die eine Kette entweder zum Kofferradio degradiert oder aber einen Jazzclub als Bühne ausbaut, in der diese Stimme den Raum bekommt den sie verdient.Und dann sah ich das Osterangebot der Bang Olufsen HX. Also kommen lassen, was gewohnt schnell ging.Schon beim unboxing war die Liebe zum Detail deutlich, was sich bei der ersten haptischen Annäherung bestätigte. Leder und gebürstetes Metall zeigen das Design eben auch mit Qualität einher gehen. (Wenn man es denn kann)Dann auf die Ohren. Ich war anfänglich etwas in Sorge da die Ohrmuscheln irgendwie zu klein aussehen, aber der Tragekomfort ist schlicht toll. Trotz der Materialauswahl ist der KH leicht und auch nach Stunden immer noch nicht unangenehm oder störendDer Memoryfoam sorgt für ein gutes Anliegen am Kopf und der Anpressdruck ist nicht störend. Gleichwohl sitzen sie sicher.Die versprochenen 30-35 Std. Ausdauer der Akkus erscheinen glaubhaft. Jedenfalls ist nach den langen, österlichen Sessions (auch mit Filmen!) am Ende der Musik übrig noch viel Akku übrig - und nicht umgekehrt!Ach, die Akkus lassen sich tauschen - ohne die KH entsorgen zu müssen. Das ist nach meiner Kenntnis der einzige Hersteller der Nachhaltigkeit groß schreibt.Doch nun zum eigentlich entscheidenden.Als erstes möchte ich das ANC abarbeiten. Mir reicht es völlig aus wenn ich im Garten NUR Musik höre und das Gezwitscher der Vögel völlig ausgesperrt ist. Wie sich das im Zug anhört oder im Flieger muss ich noch testen.Was man dann musikalisch auf die Ohren bekommt ist schon großes Kino. Egal ob Jazz, Klassic oder guter R&B - immer ist es eine wohlige Mischung aus fein und deutlich erkennbaren Instrumenten und großartigen Stimmen die die Bühne bereiten für Hörgenuss. Das alles unaufdringlich ohne sich in den Vordergrund zu spielen. Bässe kommen tiiief und knackig an, ohne auch nur ein Anzeichen von billigem Effektgehasche im Form ungebührlichen Brummens oder gar Wummern zu zeigen.Die intuitiv bedienbare App erlaubt es den Sound dem eigenen Hörempfinden oder der Musikrichtung anzupassen. Genial einfach gemacht.Die Bang Olufsen HX kommen nicht ganz an die Spielfreude und Dynamic meiner DT1770 heran, besonders wenn diese mit einem Röhrenverstärker befeuert werden.Aber das war auch nicht die AufgabeEs sind schlicht die Besten kabellosen KH die ich bis jetzt gehört habe.Ich vermisse nichts und habe meine Traumkopfhörer für den mobilen Einsatz gefunden.Die gebe ich nicht mehr weg.Update 26.08.2022Ich habe nun die KH ausgiebig auf Flugreisen (Japan) und Zugreisen testen können.Das ANC reicht mir aus. Im Flieger habe ich zuerst gedacht - die Turbinen sollte ich doch eigentlich nicht hören und lüftete die Kopfhörer um dann dankbar zu sein das ANC eine sehr großen Teile des Lärms aussperrt. So kann man immer koch Musik genießen.Auch im Zug funktioniert das sehr gut, grade bei diesem recht gleichmäßigen Geräusch.Und 12 Std Flug, zu einen großen Teil mit KH für Musik oder Filme bringen die Akkulaufzeit nicht an die Grenzen. Auch der Rückflug (14 Std.) ging ohne nachladen!!Respekt.Also alles richtig gemacht mit diesen Kopfhörern!!

Ho sempre voluto delle cuffie high end e con queste posso dire che ho realizzato il sogno.Le beoplay Hx hanno una fedeltà del suono eccezionale,  riesci sentire ogni strumento presente con alti e medi molto chiari,  l'unica nota dove magari molti non piacerà sono i bassi che non sparano in modo eccessivo,  però i bassi presenti sono molto puliti e abbastanza forti da farsi notare .Durata della batteria e molto buona,  riesci tirate tanti giorni senza ricarica .La pressione sulle orecchie non è alta direi abbastanza forte da non dare fastidio anche dopo 4 ore d'uso.Custodia un po ingombrante ma a me non da fastidio.Decisamente soddisfatto.

Ich bin auf der Suche nach einem Nachfolger für meinen Bose QC15.Verglichen habe ich damit diese Modelle:- Bowers & Wilkins P5- Bowers & Wilkins PX7- Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HXBevor die Daumen nach unten zeigen - ich weiß sehr wohl, dass der Vergleich nicht ebenbürtig ist, dass der QC15 und P5 kabelgebundene Modelle sind. Zudem handelt es sich beim P5 um ein On-Ear-Model ohne ANC...Den PX7 und den HX halte ich jedoch für auf ganzes Line vergleichbar und genau auf diese beiden aktuellen Modelle zielt meine Bewertung ab.Der PX7 hat mich sehr interessiert, da mir die Klarheit und die gute Soundauflösung des P5 sehr gut gefallen hatte. Was dem P5 an Bass fehlt hat der PX7 nun schon fast zu viel. Dabei ist es nicht wirklich die Intensität des Bass, die mich stört sondern vielmehr das der Bass ""matschig"" klingt und die verschiedenen Frequenzen (Tiefbass / Kickbass) bei den meisten Titeln verwaschen. In diesem Punkt (Bass) ist der PX7 meiner Meinung genauso gut (oder schlecht) wie der Bose QC15.Die Mitten und Höhen sind gut (viel schöner als beim QC15) aber auch hier ist Luft nach oben.Die Mitten und Höhen des B&O HX sind meiner Meinung nach Spitzenklasse. Ebenso die Soundauflösung und Ortbarkeit der Instrumente sowie auch die Stimmwiedergabe sind glasklar und sauber. Die Basswiedergabe lässt beim HX meiner Meinung nach zu wünschen übrig. Bei Lautstärken >50% ist der Bass okay. Die Bässe kommen in den verschiedenen Frequenzen klar und sauber rüber - könnten aber für meinen Geschmack etwas intensiver sein. Das Nachjustieren über die App ist einfach, führt jedoch dazu, dass auch beim HX die Bassfrequenzen verwaschen und die sauber Trennung von Tiefbass und Kickbass verloren geht.Bei leisen Lautstärken <25% zeigt sich die größte Schwäche des HX. Hier bleiben die Höhen und Mitte zwar weiterhin klar, jedoch geht das Klangvolumen völlig verloren. Bässe kommen nur noch zum Vorschein, wenn über die App massiv nachgeregelt wird.Außerdem fällt bei sehr leiser Lautstärke (oder bei pausierter Musik) ein sehr leichtes Rauschen auf, was auch durch die verschiedenen ANC-Anpassungen nicht verschwindet (nur unterschiedlich klingt).Die ANC-Funktion des PX7 ist sehr gut (vergleichbar mit dem QC15). Der HX hat hier eine deutlich geringer Geräuschunterdrückung, was mir jedoch im Hausgebrauch ausreichen würde.Der Tragekomfort ist bei allen von mir verglichen Over-Ear-Modellen sehr gut. Tendenziell würde ich dem B&O HX die beste Haptik und Komfort bescheinigen aber das ist sicher weitgehend von den anatomischen Gegebenheiten eines jeden Hörers abhängig.Alles in Allem hat mich der B&W PX7 aufgrund der ""verwaschenen"" Basswiedergabe und Unterlegenheit im Klangbild im Vergleich zum HX nicht überzeugt. Insgesamt ist es jedoch ein durchaus guter Kopfhörer, der seinen Preis (225€ bei Amazon) wert ist.Der B&O HX wäre fast mein neuer Kopfhörer geworden, wenn er nur ein wenig mehr Druck bei den Bässen, v.a. etwas mehr Volumen bei geringen Lautstärken zu bieten hätte.Meiner Einschätzung nach ist das seine einzige Schwäche und wer häufig mit mittlerer oder höherer Lautstärke (z.B. unterwegs) hört, ist mit dem HX sehr gut beraten. Für meinen Zweck, in ruhiger Couch-Umgebung auf entspannt Musik zu genießen, fehlt der letzte Schliff.

Lieferung erfolgte wie von Amazon und dem Verkäufer angegeben.Die Kopfhörer waren Originalverpackt, hätte auch nicht anderes erwartet wenn ich ein neues Produkt bestelle.Die Kopfhörer sind von der Verarbeitung als auch vom Klangbild hervorragend. Nicht zu basslastig oder zu höhenlastig. Der Klang wird in den Normaleinstellungen perfekt neutral wiedergegeben und über das App kann man sich je nach Geschmack und Musikrichtung den Sound so einstellen das er passt.Die Kopfhörer umschließen meine Ohren komplett, wo ich mir im Vorfeld nicht sicher war ob sie das tun.Das mitgelieferte Case inkl. Ladekabel und 3,5mm Kopfhörer Stecker sind ebenfalls top, wie man sich das von B&O erwartet.Wie gesagt, Top Produkt und der Preis hierfür ist auf jeden Fall angemessen.Wie gesagt, Top Kopfhörer!!!!

Mes impressions à chaud avec ce nouveau casque de B&O qui fait suite aux Beoplay 9i ..les +Qualité de construction: rien à dire c'est premium et classieux, et semble solide,Confort : très bon, léger, n'appuie pas trop sur les oreilles, pas excessif sur le haut du crâne,Connection : impeccable sur Apple iOS, rien à dire,Application : bien dans l'ensemble mais pas beaucoup de recul,Micro appels téléphoniques : la bonne surprise ! testé en environnement calme et à un carrefour passant : les bruits extérieurs sont bien neutralisés, la voix est un peu distante mais claire et compréhensible. J'ai testé beaucoup de casques sur cette fonctionnalité et B&O s'en tire très bien,Le son : très bon, je n'ai pas testé l'égaliseur dans l'appli mais c'est déjà du son premium, bien équilibré avec de bonnes basses, mediums très corrects, il me semble juste un poil trop prononcé dans les aigus. A la hauteur de l'ambition du casque mais pas sûr que ce soit le meilleur,L'étui de protection et transport : très bon, solide, protège bien et assez classe,Garantie 3 ans (après enregistrement du produit sur le site) : bravo B&O !les -La réduction de bruit : pas encore au niveau des meilleurs en réduction maximum et pas assez de recul pour un ressenti sur la réduction de bruit adapté, à voir plus tard, important car ce pourrait être une de ses grandes forces,L'ergonomie : pas habitué peut être mais les commandes sensitives sur l'oreille droite me semblent imprécises. Je dois taper/faire glisser mon doigt parfois plusieurs fois pour exécuter la commande, un peu frustrant voire désagréable (petits chocs sur l'oreille),L'ergonomie suite : régler le son en faisant glisser le doigt de manière circulaire ne fonctionne pas bien, ou alors je n'ai pas encore la pratique; ça manque de réactivité et précision, dommage, i'idée est bonne.Et donc quel rapport qualité/prix ?  c'est un casque cher et premium, cela se voit quand vous l'avez en main et l'écoutez, dommage que tout ne soit pas impeccable quant à sa manipulation (des défauts de jeunesse ?) mais c'est peut être moi qui n'ai pas encore pris l'habitude.Enfin peut être que des mises à jour de son firmware amélioreront  l'annulation de bruit, pas encore au niveau des meilleurs je pense.En espérant que cela vous soit utile.

Vorab: Ich besitze ebenfalls die Beoplay H7, und der HX ist mein erster Kopfhörer mit ANC.Positiv:Wie auch beim Vorgänger, ist sie Verarbeitung, das Material und Tragegefühl wirklich ausgezeichnet. Ich würde sogar sagen, dass der HX ein wenig gemütlicher als der H7, auf Grund der weicheren Bügelinnenseite, ist.Generell ist der Klang warm und ausgewogen. Die Höhen und Mitten sind sehr klar, man kann einzelne Instrumente wirklich gut heraushören und Orten. Es ist keiner Meinung nach nicht nötig am Equalizer in der App rumzuspielen, der Default Klang ist sehr sehr schön. An der Lautstärke ist ebenfalls nichts auszusetzen, auf 100% ist er mir zu laut, um die 70% +/- scheint mein sweet Spot, je nach Aufnahme/Song, zu liegen.Ohne Bewertung:Da ich vorher kein ANC besaß, kann ich darüber nicht viel sagen, der Effekt scheint jedoch verhältnismäßig dezent zu sein. Dunklere Töne werden deutlich besser herausgefiltert als Hochfrequente. Ich empfinde es als angenehm, wenn nichts läuft, beim Musik hören selbst, ist es mir nicht besonders aufgefallen, habe es aber auch noch nicht unter extremen Bedingungen getestet.Den Transparenz-Modus jedoch braucht man meiner Meinung nach einfach nicht. Höre mit Musik meine Umgebung immer noch nicht und ohne, kann ich die Hörer ja auch einfach absetzen.Jetzt leider etwas negatives:Die Farbe, die die Fotos suggerieren (Inkl. dem auf dem Karton), weicht bei dem ""dunklem"" Modell, von der Realität ab. Es ist ein sichtbar hellerer Grauton. Leider konnte auch ich dies nicht gut auf einem Foto einfangen. Allerdings besitze ich auch keine Fotobox o.Ä. und nur eine Smartphone Kamera.Das Touchpad ist bei weitem nicht so gut, wie beim H7. Die Funktion um Songs zu überspringen oder zurück zu spulen funktioniert nur, wenn man wirklich von Kante zu Kante des Metallteils wischt und auch dann nur sehr unzuverlässig. Gefühlte 1 von 5 malen, oft wird dann stattdessen das Lied pausiert oder es passiert einfach nichts. Selbst die einfache Pause-Funktion, mit einer einzelnen Berührung führt nicht immer zum gewünschten Ergebnis. Von der Laut/Leise-Funktion wage ich kaum zu sprechen. Sie funktionierte bei mir bisher schlichtweg gar nicht. (Allerdings gab es dort auch bei meinem H7 kleinere Probelme).Kurzgesagt: Touchpad, nicht gut.Fazit:Wem es rein um Klang und Tragekomfort geht wird hier vermutlich nichts missen. Wenn allerdings andere technische Spielereien (ANC, Touch-Control) sehr wichtig sind, sollte sich das ganze vorher mal genauer anschauen.Für meine Bedürfnisse finde ich es jedoch ein sehr gelungenes Produkt. Allerdings kann man bei dem Preis auch mehr Perfektion in den genannten ""Problembereichen"" erwarten.

I bought these in a sale and got them for around £300 instead of the usual price. After using them for a while I would definitely say the sale price is “getting your moneys worth” but at the normal price, I’d understand if someone said they were disappointed.I work as a mechanic in a workshop environment, it’s always noisy and the headphones get bashed about a bit. I’ve owned them for two months now and have hit them, scraped them and dropped them against all sorts of car components and I’m very impressed by the complete lack of damage.The noise cancellation is okay, I wouldn’t say it’s absolutely amazing. Anything noisier than a hand dryer and you can hear it as if you’re not wearing the headphones, but for commuting or general use, it’s fine.I am overall impressed and would recommend them, the battery life is pretty impressive but the app is a bit clunky and a bit of a let down.

These are a downgrade over previous models I have. Not as well built and the sound is definitely not to my liking (the H9i and 3rd gen have a much richer and broader sound). I find myself listening to my older models. The extra battery life is a positive but you can't replace the battery so that's also a negative. I wouldn't recommend these unless they're heavily discounted in a sale.

Got these for a great price but they did not live up to my expectations. To make it clear they sound superb and are top draw build quality; but they are flawed on many levels. The main problem is the size and shape of the ear cups. If you have larger ears they will sit on your ears and will become uncomfortable very quickly. Secondly they were very inconsistent locating my Wi-Fi. Sent them back with some reluctance.

Le cuffie sono realizzate in maniera impeccabile. Hanno un suono meraviglioso. Ma hanno delle gravissime pecche che mi fanno portare a restituirle, considerando il costo di acquisto molto alto. Io le ho pagate 399 ma il loro prezzo è 499!!!! I controlli touch sono pessimi. Non possono essere utilizzate con cavo senza accenderle, quindi con batteria scarica non le puoi usare. Delusione--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATTENZIONE AGGIORNAMENTO DEL 06/02/2022Innanzitutto voglio ringraziare Amazon. Queste cuffie le ho rese 2 volte. Alla 3° volta che le ho ordinate sono perfette. Il suono è meraviglioso, sono realizzate in maniera impeccabile ed ora al terzo tentativo finalmente i controlli touch funzionano. Sono stato tenace, ma la mia tenacia senza il servizio resi di amazon , non sarebbe stata premiata. Ditemi quale negozio ti dà la possibilità di rendere per ben 2 volte lo stesso prodotto??? Esiste è Amazon!!! Se non le avessi rese 2 volte (non è un gioco) non avrei ottenuto un prodotto meraviglioso come questo!!! Mi suonava male che un marchio prestigioso come Bang&Olufsen mettesse in commercio un prodotto così scadente. Non mi sono arreso fiducioso del marchio. Ma tutto questo è soltanto grazie ad Amazon!!! Mi scuso per averle rese ben 2 volte, ma alla fine avevo ragione io. Sono soltanto incappato in 2 articoli diciamo difettosi. Grazie ancora AMAZON 👏👏👏👏👏Riguardo al prodotto in oggetto, rimangono alcune lacune ""trascurabili"" visto il meraviglioso suono.1) non si possono ascoltare con il cavo da spente, bisogna comunque accenderle. 2) non hanno una guida vocale, ed in particolare questa carenza si sente quando si attiva l'ANC, alla pressione del tasto si sente un suono che si fà fatica a capire a cosa è associato, sarebbe stato utile un messaggio vocale: ANC ON - ANC LOW - ANC MEDIUM - ANC HIGHT- ANC AUTO- ANC OFF....per il resto prodotto da 5 stelle.

Bon alors comment ne pas y aller par 4 chemins..... ce casque est une purge au niveau des commandes, ça marche quand ça veut et on se retrouve très souvent a utiliser les commandes logiciel et donc vu le prix ça pique un peut ! Même beaucoup, seulement voila, le son est limpide, équilibré et le confort au rdv. Très franchement j'aurais renvoyé ce casque si la qualité globale n'était pas au niveau du prix car le reste c'est un zéro pointé.La réduction de bruit fait très correctement le travail et permet de réduire le niveau sonore tout en gardant une bonne dynamique.L'équaliseur de l'application est très bien fait.La mise a jour du firmware a été plutôt épique, déco, reco , déco , reco ... et sans savoir pourquoi ça fini par se faire.. Je suis sur un Oneplus 8 Pro donc pas de soucis niveau compatibilité bluetooth mais la je n'ai pas tout compris.Bref, moi qui cherchait un super casque pour une qualité d'écoute, je suis servi , pour les commandes, la copie est a revoir !

These are excellent wireless headphones and are very easy to use. The build quality is a step above the Sony's etc and for my use the noise cancelling is great. The beoplay app is very simple and provides just the right amount of control for some tinkering. The sound profile out of the box is pretty much spot on for most music types. These are as good as you can get for consumer wireless headphones at this price point.

Im Grunde gibt es nichts, was zu diesem Kopfhörer nicht schon gesagt worden wäre. Die Tonqualität, der Klang – erstklassig. Das ANC System arbeitet ganz hervorragend. Die Materialien sind erstklassig; keine Frage. Das einzige, woran sich hier die Geister scheiden, ist der Innendurchmesser der Ohrpolster. Menschen mit kleinen bis mittelgroßen Ohren haben hier überhaupt keine Probleme. Aber Leute mit größerem Kopf, sprich; großen Ohren werden hier keine Freude haben. Denn entweder werden die Polster das Rohr am unteren oder am oberen Ende ein klemmen. Das mag für 20 Minuten Musikhören noch tragbar sein, aber wenn man den Kopfhörer für lange Zeit tragen möchte – Flugreisen, Bahnreisen etc. – dann macht das keinen Spaß. Vielleicht sollte sogar ein Hersteller wie Bang und Olufsen etwas weniger aufs Design schauen, als auf das, was die Kunden tatsächlich brauchen.

Ich habe eine ganze Weile gezögert, so relativ teure Kopfhörer zu kaufen, aber ich muss sagen, das hat sich absolut gelohnt. Klang, Komfort und Materialverarbeitung dieser Headphones ist absolut top.Vergleichen kann ich es leider nur mit den Bose QC35II, der Sound ist aber in einer ganz anderen Klasse als diese. Detailreich, klar, saubere Höhen und Bässe. Gerade die Bässe, druckvoll und präsent, ohne einem nach 30 Minuten die Ohren vollzubrummen. A Propos Ohren, Tragekomfort ist gut. Auch wenn die Muscheln kleiner sind als die vom Bose, meine Ohren passen rein und die Hörer liegen satt und mit sanftem Druck um die Ohren herum auf.Das ANC ist nach meinem Empfinden super, mindestens dem Bose ebenbürtig. Das muss sich aber noch bei einem Interkontinentalflug bestätigen.Die App ist allerdings zwingend nötig, um den Klang optimal einzustellen. Die Default-Einstellung war mir zu neutral, habe dann im Equalizer die ""Energetic"" Einstellung gewählt. Auch die ANC-Einstellungen sollte man für seinen eigenen Geschmack optimieren.Bei so viel Licht gibt es aber auch etwas Schatten: - die Gestensteuerung ist für mich immer noch ein Glücksspiel. Das einzige was zuverlässig funktioniert ist Start/Stopp. Lautstärkeeinstellung per Kreisbewegung klappt nach einigen Drehungen irgendwann, aber nicht zuverlässig. Und Vorwärts/zurück klappt überhaupt nicht. Oh well... - ab und zu gibt es Bluetooth-Hänger, besonders wenn man zwischen Geräten wechselt. Es hilft dann immer aus/anschalten. - die farbliche Ausführung ist katastrophal. Ich hatte mir eigentlich die Ausführung in ""Timber"" bestellt. Leider kommen die nicht in braunem Leder, sondern eher in einem orangen Ton. B&O Support konnte mir hier nicht helfen, also bin ich auf ""Anthrazit"" umgestiegen. Die sind auch nicht schwarz, sondern eher ein dunkles grau, aber besser als orange...Fazit: diese Kopfhörer sind definitiv ihr Geld wert.

But the noise cancelling occasionally didn’t kick in and the responses from the on ear controls was a little erratic at times. Sound quality is good but not quite to the standard I was hoping for...no better really than my 4 years old and cheaper AKGs. Returned them.

Qualità audio e costruttiva eccezionali. Ottima durata della batteria (ci si dimentica di ricaricarle), buona la cancellazione del rumore...Le uniche pecche che mi sento di segnalare sono i controlli touch per il volume che non sono molto immediati e il rilevamento di quando ti togli le cuffie per metterle in pausa che non sempre funziona...

Tout d'abord, un magnifique appareil : belle ""gueule"", beaux matériaux, magnifique pochette de transport. C'est important d'avoir le sourire en déballant le produit.Ensuite un confort de roi. On ne sent pas l'appareil sur la tête, on peut le garder plusieurs heures sans fatiguer.Enfin le son. Ce n'est certes pas la qualité de mon filaire, nous sommes sur du bluetooth. Mais c'est tellement supérieur aux autres casques bluetooth que j'ai essayé ! La liberté que nous apporte cet appareil est à ce (petit) prix.Je n'ai pu tester la réduction de bruit, j'ai la chance de vivre au milieu des oiseaux.Il y a probablement mieux sur chacun des points ci-dessus, mais l'ensemble est parfait pour moi.Alors, merci B&O et merci Amazon pour la promotion qui rend le coût nettement plus raisonnable.

Ich habe mir diese Kopfhörer gekauft, nachdem ich jahrelang begeistert meine BeoPlay H9i nutzen durfte, meine ersten ANC Kopfhörer. Diese hatten die beste Geräuschunterdrückung, die man sich wünschen konnte und erstklassigen Sound und Bedienung.Leider ist der An-Aus-Schieberegler ins Jenseits gegangen und ich konnte bisher keinen Ersatz aus Fernost finden, den ich stattdessen hätte einlöten können.Also mussten neue ANC Kopfhörer her, natürlich wieder aus dem Hause B&O.Und dann war die Enttäuschung groß.Das ANC der BeoPlay HX ist hier in drei Stufen unterteilt:""Transparenz"" (man hört die Umgebung quasi, als trüge man keine Kopfhörer),""Adaptiv"" (Umgebungsgeräusche werden nicht so stark gedämpft, dafür hört man kaum bis keine Windgeräusche) und""ANC"" (Umgebungsgeräusche werden sehr stark gedämpft, allerdings hat man störende Windgeräusche, wenn man sich bewegt).Selbst das ""ANC"" ist für mich subjektiv von der Geräuschunterdrückung einfach nicht ausreichend, und ich bin regelrecht enttäuscht von den lauten Windgeräuschen. Die Option ""Windgeräusche unterdrücken"" in der B&O App bringt auch keine Abhilfe und setzt sich immer wieder zurück; der Support geht nicht darauf ein.Auch die Gestensteuerung (an der rechten Hörmuschel entlangstreichen zum Lied wechseln oder in einer Kreisbewegung die Lautstärke ändern hat bei den H9i wesentlich besser funktioniert als bei den HX.Positiv zu bemerken ist, dass es jetzt keine Schieberegler mehr gibt, die kaputt gehen könnten.Auch die Tonqualität ist noch einmal nach oben gegangen, hätte nicht gedacht, dass das möglich ist.Bluetooth ist auch stabiler und akkuschonender als noch bei den H9i.

Over the years, Ive owned multiple headphones from Bang and Olufsen. I gotta say I'm so disapointed. The previous H8 was an okay one. I was hoping for a sound quality upgrade but that didnt happen. The functions such as music turning off and on when you take off your headphones really improved. At point, but the sound is really horrible. My experience was like this. It sounds like you're listening to a music over the wall. Absolutely no bass. Somehow the vocals were really impressive. I like the headphones to be comfy. My H4 2nd's earcups are much softer. Hmmm why. I guess you get the build quality and the technology for this price.Hopefully someone reads my comment and reconsider buying these headphones. but at the same time, its my personal opinion so yeah

They are so beautiful, with luxurious materials, comfortable, and all, as expected.BUT:- completely useless if you wish to work on MS teams or make calls. That’s not what they are for. These are for listening to music.- The sound is very good but not as good as in Bowers and Wilkins PX7 (still better than the rest though)- The ear cushions are not as padded as in Beoplay H4 (H4 is more comfortable and over all better looking)- The finger controls on the side of the earcups are just terrible, mostly useless. Bring back buttons or make this work better.- multi pairing doesn’t work as it should. It messes up connections, volumes, stays connected when they are supposed to be off,  etc.Try a pair of Poly Bluetooth headphones and you will experience good calls and good multi pairing (but you won’t look as cool as with these beoplay HX!!!).- ANC is basically useless. My Jabra Elite 75 have much more effective noise cancellation. The difference between having ANC on or off is so little that I could never tell what mode was active

Ottimo  prodotto,  costruito in  modo impeccabile con materiali di pregio. Ottimo suono, che ognuno può  regolare secondo i propri gusti tramite app, che è l' unico neo di queste cuffie. Alcune  volte, ma raramente, l' app non trova le cuffie, che cmq funzionano  ugualmente. Rifarei  sicuramente  l' acquisto,  soprattutto al prezzo in offerta amazon  a cui le ho trovate io, 349 euro. Correggo  la recensione. App pessima,  sono più  le volte che non riconosce  le cuffie  che quelle che si collega.  Ogni volta, praticamente,  che accendo le cuffie, devo disinstallare l' app, installarla  di nuovo,  accedere, e sperare che riconosca  le cuffie. Le cuffie  in sé, sono stupende,  ma l' app fa perdere qualità  al prodotto  essendo pessima.

The best headphones I've ever owned. You have to embrace that they are not for running but nothing beats these bno's. The bass is exceptional. The midrange sounds are clear. They are great with phone calls. The construction is solid and robust. Struggle to go anywhere without them. This is coming from someone who owned the bass heavy Sony mx3s.

Ich hatte die Kopfhörer insbesondere bestellt, weil mir die Optik so gut gefallen hat. War aber leider vom Produkt selbst enttäuscht, so dass es zurück ging. Das hatte mehrere Gründe. Nummer 1: Der Sound ist okay, aber wenn die Bässe etwas stärker werden, irgendwie nicht überzeugend. Nummer 2: Der Bügel ist ziemlich schwer. Das finde ich sowohl für den Tragekomfort als auch für die Flexibilität des normalen Bewegungsablaufes einschränkend. Nummer 3: Obwohl das Modell explizit mit Apple-Konnektivität beworben wird, hatte ich mehrfach Verbindungsprobleme. Das nervt... Nummer 4: Bei meinem Produkt war leider die Touch-Funktion defekt. Da würde ich mir eine besser Qualitätskontrolle wünschen, aber selbst wenn sie funktioniert hätte, wäre mir das Produkt bei den bereits benannten Mängeln den Preis nicht wert gewesen. Dabei hatte ich es schon zum Blackfriday reduziert erworben. Also für denselben Preis lieber die AirPod Pros 2. Gen bestellt, die auch das Noice-Cancelling deutlich besser hinbekommen. Fazit: Für den Preis hätte ich mehr erwartet. Der telefonische Kundenservice von Bang & Olufsen war jedoch sehr gut, Lob dafür!

Ils sont carrément merveilleux! D’emblée je suis un grand fan de B&O, j’ai eu les H6 1rst Gen, H8 rst Gen, H9 1rst Gen, H9 2nd Gen et maintenant les HX. Les HX sont dans une ligue à part en se qui attrait à la qualité de fabrication. Aluminium anodisé, cuir véritable, étui de transport (ENFIN) robuste… Ils légers et confortables. La techonologie ANC que B&O propose est efficace. Ils ne sont pas premiers de classe en la matière, mais n’ont pas à rougir face à la concurrence.Out of the box j’avoue que je n’étais pas certain de la signature sonore des HX. Je les trouvais amorphes, sans vie. Mais il suffit de jouer avec l’equalizer via l’application de Bang & Olufsen et le tour est joué. Les basses fréquences prennent du coffre et les aiguës deviennent plus assumées. Si votre budget vous le permet, vous ne serai pas déçu!

Ich schreibe hier nur meine subjektiv wahrgenommenen Empfindungen. Der Kopfhörer überrascht mit einer Trageleichtigkeit die ich als sehr angenehm und beeindruckend empfinde ( geht in Richtung Grado GH2 den ich Zuhause verwende).Habe heute Nachmittag meinen persönlichen Hörgeschmack auf der dafür notwendigen App eingestellt und anschließend mehrere Titel unterschiedlicher Stilrichtungen mittels meinem mp3 Player gehört . Was ich da hörte war zum Niederknien. Ein Sound für Götter!Die Ohrschmeichler lassen Klangbilder entstehen ( entsprechend der persönlichen Stilrichtung) als wären sie von den berühmtesten Malern in Auftrag gegeben worden. Himmlische Sphären, irdische Mitten und ein höllischer Bass; alles so präzise platziert wiedergegeben wie es die Tontechnik aufgenommen hat. Ein musischer Genuss der bei einem Noise cancelling Kopfhörer seinesgleichen sucht.Mein Abendspaziergang entlang einer Eisenbahnlinie auf der mehrerer Züge der DB vorbeifuhren trübten meine Hörfreude, dank eines perfekt wirkenden Noise draußen bleiben Effekts, keineswegs. Eine für mich elegante Lösung ist das vor/zurückspringen der Musiktitel mittels wisch und weg am rechten Hörer bzw. Laut/Leise Turnaround am linken Hörer mittels Touch.Spotify über mein IPHONE war eine schöne Unterhaltung auf meinen Weg zurück nach Hause.Ich bin glücklich auf meine alten Tage endlich die Kopfhörer für mich gefunden zu haben die ich allen Musikfreunden und Liebhabern des guten Geschmacks guten Gewissens empfehlen kann. Mein Dank geht letztendlich an all jene Menschen die an diesem phantastischen Kopfhörer mitgewirkt haben. PS. Listen to the Music and enjoy yourself! Anspieltip: Immigration Song ( Led Zepp )

Ich besitze eine H95 und einen H9i mit denen ich die HX vergleichen konnte, zusätzlich auch die AirPods Max und einige andere aktuelle BT Hörer. Kurz zusammen gefasst, an die Tonqualität, das ANC und die Verarbeitung des H95 kommt der HX nicht ran, aber er überflügelt den H9i und ist deutlich näher am H95 dran als am H9i (Eigentlich fehlen nur einige Kleinigkeiten). Ich würde den Klang neutral ins leicht warme bezeichnen. Die Höhen sind im Vergleich zum H9i nicht mehr so überspitzt, die Mitten besser gezeichnet und der Bass schön knackig, aber nicht zu hervorgehoben. Insbesondere der Bass ist deutlich besser als beim AirPod Max. Das ANC ist besser als beim H9i aber schlechter als bei den AirPod Max oder H95. Wenn man also auf ANC Wert liegt gibt es sicher bessere, aber auch schlechtere. Mit aktivierten ANC wir der Bass ein wenig stärker, aber weit entfernt von Beats oder einem B&W PX7 Transparenz Modus ist ähnlich der AirPod Max wirklich sehr gut. Anders als beim H9i ist die Aktivierung deutlich einfacher über einen Knopf am linken Hörer, auch der Druckknopf für an/aus ist besser als der Schieberegler des Vorgängers. Im Vergleich zu den AirPod Max hört der Sitznachbar nichts von der Musik die man gerade hört.Auch die Verarbeitung ist nochmals deutlich besser als beim H9i und mindestens genauso gut wie bei den AirPod Max.Zusammenfassend hat B&O einen richtig guten Kopfhörer auf den Markt gebracht, dessen Verarbeitung mustergültig ist und den Vorgänger deutlich übertrifft. ANC ist sehr gut aber es gibt bessere. Wer auf einen sehr guten, nicht anstrengenden super detailreichen und neutral/minimal warmen Sound wert legt ist mit diesem Kopfhörer bestens bedient.

ホームページにはあらゆる曲にマッチ、と書いてありましたが正直言って低音が出ていなさすぎてロック系の音楽には合わないなと思いました。BeoplayEQ、BeoplayH95も所有していますが、比較してもHXの低音の弱さはダントツです。発売時期と値段からしてEQの音に近いかな、と思いきやE8に近い感じです。バランスの良いフラットな音、というよりは高音域寄り。クラシック等を聞くにはいいかもしれません。

Le casque est très confortable, le meilleur que j'ai essayé.  Le son est très bon aussi. moins basseux que Sony. (Je dispose d'un sony Wh-1000xm2).  Par contre l'ANC n'est pas au niveau. Je prends le train 3h par jours, il me faut un casque avec une ANC correcte. Le casque ne parvient pas à masquer les bruits ambients. Il masque le roulement du train et c'est tout. les voix, les annonces dans le train sont clairement audibles. Je suis revenu sur le sony qui a une meilleur ANC et avec lequel les bruits de train sont vraiment atténué.Il est bien pour être porté pendant de longue session de télétravail mais pas pour les transports.Je trouve dommage de payer 500€ pour un casque qui n'a pas une ANC au niveau d'un casque qui date de 2017.

I waited a week for this to arrive and was pretty excited. Once I received the item, I noticed there was no seal on the headphone box at all?? Not sure if this is due to b&o not putting a seal, or simply because someone has taken it off at Amazon. To my genuine surprise, there was nothing in the box! There was a manual on how to use the headphones and that’s all. I have tried starting a live chat or calling amazon and nothing works, it just doesn’t load. I’ve had to result in sending back an empty box for a refund. I am super frustrated as I brought these during the black friday sale and was excited for them. I will not be buying an item like this off of amazon again if this is the case. More protection is needed for such high value units! Customer obsession where?!

Extremadamente cómodos, medios y agudos fantásticos, y una calidad inigualable en comparación con todos los demás auriculares que probé (PX7, Aonic 50, Momentum 3, WH-1000XM4).

This brand new model has about the same sound as my 1st generation H4's that I heavily used since late 2018, that finally failed due to a missing plastic thingy, allowing to let the headband slide out.They're heavier, clamp down on the head harder and the new features are nothing to write home about, except maybe transparency mode.The wear detection feature is half baked at best and turns of podcasts whenever I move my head too fast during a walk on the beach.So, not great, overall. At leas t the headband issue is likely fixed, not sure whether I'll keep these long enough to find out.

Ich muss ehrlich zugeben, dass ich diese Kopfhörer bestellt habe, ohne die Marke zu kennen oder mich vorher groß mit ihnen auseinanderzusetzen. Ich höre allerdings in meinem Alltag sehr viel Musik und habe schon so manches Paar an Kopfhörern ausprobiert.Mein erster Eindruck war sehr positiv. Die Beoplay HX kommen in einer sehr stabilen, hochwertig wirkenden Tasche, in der sich Kopfhörer und Ladekabel sicher verstauen lassen. Die Kopfhörer selbst sind offensichtlich sehr hochwertig verarbeitet. Wo andere (selbst hochpreisige) Modelle vor allem mit Plastik verarbeitet sind, glänzen die Beoplay HX durch sehr angenehmes, der Haut schmeichelndes, mattes Metall. Dadurch wirken sie nahezu unverwüstlich, obwohl ich natürlich angesichts des Preises dennoch zu Vorsicht im Umgang rate. Die Größe der Kopfhörer lässt sich stufenlos und auf beiden Seiten unabhängig voneinander verstellen, was gerade mir als Person mit großen Kopf sehr gut gefällt. Das Design finde ich auch wirklich angenehm understated.Das Set-Up war denkbar einfach. Die Beoplay HX fanden die Verbindung zu meinem Handy via Bluetooth problemlos und ließen sich gleich einwandfrei nutzen. Bei mir führte es jedoch kurz zu Irritation, dass eine Mitteilung auftauchte, dass man die zugehörige App downloaden könnte, bei der der Link jedoch auch nach mehreren Versuchen ins Nichts lief. Die Bang & Olufsen App ließ sich jedoch ohne große Probleme auch so im Playstore finden und war im Nu installiert. Die Verbindung der App zu den Kopfhörern klappt auch einwandfrei, auch wenn mich zu Beginn etwas irritierte, dass diese Verbindung nur möglich ist, wenn man der App den Zugriff auf den eigenen Standort erlaubt (ich hätte erwartet, dass eine Bluetooth Berechtigung ausreicht, aber wer den Klang seiner Kopfhörer anpassen will, muss zumindest während die App läuft den Standortzugriff erlauben). Davon abgesehen ist die Bedienung der App sehr intuitiv und einfach. Es werden mehrere voreingestellte Soundprofile angeboten, die Lautstärke der Kopfhörer selbst (nicht zu verwechseln mit der Gerätelautstärke) kann angepasst werden und ein eigenes Soundprofil kann angelegt werden. Als Joggerin habe ich vor allem das voreingestellte Work-Out Soundprofil zum Laufen genutzt und war sehr zufrieden damit.Der Klang der Kopfhörer ist wie erwartet ausgezeichnet. Beim Hören einiger Songs meine ich auf einmal Hintergrundklänge heraushören zu können, die mir zuvor nie aufgefallen sind. Auch die Noise Cancelling Technologie funktioniert absolut einwandfrei, sodass man selbst durch die belebte Stadt navigieren kann, ohne groß beim Erleben der eigenen Musik gestört zu werden (aber auch ohne Gefahr zu laufen, herannahende Autos zu überhören). Ich glaube wirklich, diese Kopfhörer wären bei langen Zugfahrten ein Traum. Aber auch beim Training und beim Beiwohnen diverser Zoomsessions gefielen mir diese Kopfhörer bisher sehr gut.Für mich war der einzige kleine Wermutstropfen dann doch der Tragekomfort. Die Kopfhörer sind gewiss nicht die unbequemsten, die ich je getragen habe, aber trotz ihrer Preisklasse auch nicht die Vorreiter auf diesem Gebiet im Vergleich zu anderen Kopfhörern, die ich bisher ausprobiert habe. Menschen mit langen Haaren würde ich zunächst einmal raten, vorsichtig zu sein, dass keine Haare in die Scharniere der Kopfhörer geraten. Dies ist mir zum Glück nur am ersten Tag einmal passiert, seitdem passe ich besser auf, aber ich bin auf diesem Wege tatsächlich einmal eine Strähne Haar losgeworden - hier merkt man eben, dass das sauber verarbeitete Metall deutlich unnachgiebiger ist als so manches Paar an Plastikkopfhörern. Ich muss auch sagen, dass ich eine Weile brauchte, um die Höheneinstellung der Kopfhörer so zu erfassen, dass der obere Bogen nicht nach einiger Zeit began, etwas unangenehm zu drücken. Die Beoplay HX sind zwar an sich gut gepolstert, aber im Laufe etwa einer langen Zoomsession baut sich doch manchmal der Druck etwas auf. Man muss an dieser Stelle jedoch anmerken, dass ich wirklich einen relativ großen Kopf habe und meine Erfahrung da vielleicht nicht die aller anderen widerspiegelt. Wenn man die Beoplay HX immer mal wieder nachadjustiert, sodass der Bogen nicht immer auf die gleiche Stelle drückt, ist das auch kein besonders gravierendes Problem. Ich finde dennoch, dass man das für diesen Preis zumindest erwähnen sollte. Beim Laufen fand ich die Beoplay HX hingegen recht angenehm und mir fiel positiv auf, dass sie auch beim Schwitzen nicht verrutschen, wie das bei manch anderem Modell der Fall ist.---------------------------Zusammenfassend:Insgesamt sind das hier wohl klanglich gesehen zweifelsfrei die besten Kopfhörer, die ich je ausprobieren durfte. Sie klingen sauber und verleihen der Musik Tiefe, die ich sonst nicht kannte. Die Kopfhörer selbst und die App lassen sich leicht und intuitiv bedienen und es gibt viele Möglichkeiten, den Sound den eigenen Bedürfnissen anzupassen. Die Kopfhörer sehen gut aus und kommen mit einer hochwertigen Tragetasche. Die einzigen kleinen Mankos für mich sind die verpflichtende Standortangabe bei der Nutzung der App (wobei die Appnutzung wiederrum ein Muss ist, wenn man den Klang anpassen möchte) und dass ich finde, dass der Tragekomfort für den Preis noch etwas mehr im Fokus stehen könnte. Da ich finde, dass diese Anmerkungen jedoch im Großen und Ganzen verschmerzbar sind, gebe ich trotzdem gerne eine Empfehlung für die Beoplay HX ab. Wer klaren, individualisierbaren Klang möchte, ist hier bestimmt nicht falsch.

Die Beoplay HX sind für Wireless-Kopfhörer schon fast ein Vorbild: Sie sind sehr bequem, klingen gut, haben eine gute App inkl. Equalizer und sehen gut aus.Neben den HX liegt ein USB-A auf USB-C Ladekabel (ja, leider kein C auf C), ein Hardcase, sowie ein relativ kurzes 3,5mm Audiokabel bei. Ich habe den HX mit einem iPhone, MacBook Pro (beide mit Tidal und Apple Music) und einer PlayStation 5 getestet, wegen letzterer veröffentliche ich diese Rezension etwas später.Das eigentlich wichtigste zuerst: Der Klang ist super! Super neutral, aber wenn man möchte geht das in mehrere andere Richtungen durch die App (keine Desktop-Version erhältlich). Für den recht geringen Frequenzbereich (von 20khz) bis zu 22khz klingt es vor allem mit Tidal doch ziemlich detailliert. Das liegt wahrscheinlich an den Treibern und den Ohrpolstern. Als Codecs ist der Standard, also aptx, SBC, etc. dabei. aptx HD wird nicht unterstützt. Das macht bei der Frequenz auch keinen Sinn. Allerdings wäre ich sehr interessiert, was B&O hier mit 40khz+ und aptx HD o. Ä. auf die Beine stellen können.Mit angeschalteter Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) also Geräuschunterdrückung klingt der HX wie erwartet am besten. Das ANC macht einen guten Eindruck, ist in stiller Umgebung natürlich unnötig (Nachtrag: Zum Zeitpunkt des ersten Tests gab es einen Lockdown). Um die Baustelle vor der Haustür oder die Fluggeräusche im Flugzeug abzudämpfen, reicht es aus.Der Tragekomfort ist wie beworben sehr gut, bis perfekt. Das kommt natürlich an die Kopfform der Person an. Bei mir bleibt es meistens sehr gut, sogar nach mehreren Stunden (also wie es sein soll). Das Verstellen der Ohrmuscheln ist ähnlich wie bei den AirPods Max sehr smooth. Allerdings sind die Ohrpolster nicht für Sport geeignet. Das ist ein wenig schade, weil die HX nicht sehr viel wiegen und schon für Sport interessant wären.Die Akkulaufzeit ist mit etwa 30-35h ordentlich und nicht selbstverständlich.Zu den Features / Gimmicks:- Der Transparency Mode ist sehr gut und fast gleichauf mit dem der AirPods Max. Sehr hilfreich, natürlich eher für unterwegs.- Die Touch-Funktionen funktionieren leider nicht immer. Tippen wird meistens registriert, aber Streichen sehr selten.Mein Gaming ""Test"": Ich habe etwas mit dem Test gebraucht, weil ich erst einen geeigneten Bluetooth Adapter finden musste. Der HX unterstützt BT 5.1. Allerdings gibt es eigentlich keine Transmitter, die das (sowie die PlayStation) unterstützen. Es gibt billige mit leeren Versprechen...Deswegen habe ich zu BT 5.0 gegriffen, nämlich zum ""Gulikit Route Air+ Pro"". Das soll keine Werbung sein, aber lasst mich meine Erfahrung damit teilen: Er funktioniert mit dem HX, sogar recht gut. Das Mikrofon konnte ich noch nicht testen, das werde ich dann hier ergänzen. Eine kleine Verzögerung gibt es leider, weil nur aptx ausgewählt wird, nicht aptx LL (low latency). Eigentlich könnte der HX aptx LL unterstützen, da warte ich noch auf den Kundenservice. Update: Der HX kann NICHT aptx LL.Das war soweit das Positive, jetzt zu den Kritikpunkten: Das Preis- / Leistungsverhältnis schwankt leider, ich möchte mich aber vor allem auf den Frequenzbereich beziehen. Denn für fast 500€ könnte man wenigstens 40khz erwarten, die Konkurrenz mal außen vor gelassen.Um jetzt doch einen Vergleich (als Bsp.) zu nennen: Der Beyerdynamic ""Aventho Wireless"" & Wired klingt besser (vor allem mit dem Impacto von Beyerdynamic), als der Beoplay HX, kostet auch nur die Hälfte, ist aber nicht so bequem wie der HX. Der „Amiron Home“ klingt besser und ist sehr angenehm zu tragen, auch günstiger aber natürlich offen. Beide haben kein Mikrofon und sind nicht wireless. Es gibt beide aber in einer Wireless Variante, die anders klingt.Deswegen ist der HX meiner Meinung nach besser für z. B. Gaming gedacht, als für Musik. Aber halt- B&O hat doch ein ähnliches Gaming-Headset entwickelt, oder? Genau, nämlich der ""Beoplay Portal"". Einen sehr großen Unterschied sollten diese Geräte nicht haben, aber wenn Interesse an einem ""Premium"" Gaming-Headset besteht, dann probieren Sie bitte den Portal aus. Wer bereit ist diesen Preis zu bezahlen, der sollte es sich genau überlegen.Ich bin ganz ehrlich, ich empfehle euch beim Kabel zu bleiben und damit auch bei Kopfhörern wie dem Aventho Wired und vor allem dem Amiron Home (bester Kopfhörer, den ich kenne). Das klingt jetzt wieder wie Werbung, ich weiß, aber Beyerdynamic macht den Sound in diesem Preissegment (und in den anderen) einfach am besten.Falls B&O manche Dinge verbessert, sieht das natürlich anders aus. Noch kann ich den HX aber nicht weiterempfehlen; Ich empfehle dennoch jedem diesen Kopfhörer zu testen, das schadet keinem.Das kabellose Zeitalter ist noch nicht ganz hier. Plump gesagt kommt es erst, wenn jeder einzelne BT-Kopfhörer (bildlich gesprochen) Google Chromecast und (Qualcomm) aptx HD eingebaut hat.Warum vier Sterne? Weil es trotz des Preises ein sehr guter Kopfhörer ist und ich das Gesamtpaket genossen habe. Außerdem: Jede Ohren / Kopfformen sind anders, das muss man bei Audio immer beachten.Ich erwähne das eigentlich nie, aber ein kleines Heads-Up: Mir wurde der Beoplay HX für diese Rezension kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt. Ich habe hier meine Meinung und objektive Erfahrung unabhängig davon geschildert.

Für Eilige:Klang:  5 SterneAkkulaufzeit: 5 SterneDesign und Verarbeitung: 5 SterneBedienung: 4 SterneTragekomfort: 4 SterneNoise-Cancelling: 4 SterneTransportabilität: 3 SterneDas aktuelle Oberklassemodell der kabellosen Over-Ears des dänischen Nobelherstellers wagen keine großen und mutigen Designänderungen: wie schon Vorgänger und andere Modelle der Beoplay Serie ist der HX nicht zuletzt aufgrund des Runden Ohrmuscheldesigns, der großen Touch-Flächen der des großen B&O-Logos als solcher zu erkennen. Von dieser Seite nicht viel neues.Die Neuerungen finden sich denn auch eher im Detail: längere Akkulaufzeit (B&O verspricht bis zu 35 Stunden!), besseres Noise-Cancelling durch 4 Mikrophone, verbesserte Treiber und vor allem alle aktuellen Bluetooth-Standards inkl. verlustfreier Übertragung sollen den HX attraktiv machen.Neben den Hörer findet sich ein kleines (sehr kurzes) Audiokabel und ein USB-A auf USB-C Ladekabel. Das wertige Case aus Hartkunstoff schützt den edlen Kopfhörer beim Transport. Dieser lässt sich leider nicht vollständig zusammenfalten und macht sich im Rucksack ganz schön breit. Da macht sich die Konkurrenz doch deutlich kleiner.Über die Haptik kann man nicht meckern, im Gegenteil: Die verwendeten Materialen (Leder, Aluminium, hochwertige Stoffe) wirken edel und robust. Die Verarbeitung ist vorbildlich. Bei einem Vorgängermodell hatte ich schon mal nach kurzer Tragezeit kleine Risse im Leder der Ohrmuscheln. Diese konnte ich bei diesem Modell nicht feststellen.Wer den vollen Bedienkomfort des Beoplay haben möchte, kommt um die App für iOs und Android nicht herum. Nur hier lässt sich die Klangcharakteristik und das adaptive Noise-Cancelling fein justieren. Am Hörer selbst kann letzteres nur in drei Stufen durchgeschaltet werden.  Ein kleiner Kritikpunkt ist die Klangeinstellung nur in blumig betitelten Einstellfeld (Entspannt, Hell, Warm etc) einstellen. Ein echter (Band-) Equalizer wäre mir lieber.Die Bedienung ansonsten erfolgt über die großen Touchflächen der Ohrmuscheln. Titelsprung, Lautstärke lassen sich mit Wischgesten steuern. Mit etwas Übung funktioniert das sehr gut und sieht obendrein noch cool aus.Am Tragekomfort scheiden sich die Geister: Während viele Hörer der Mitbewerber gerade bei den das Ohr umschließenden Modellen auf ovale Ohrmuscheln setzten, bleibt B&O bei den kreisrunden Polstern. Bei sehr großen Ohren kann das unbequem sein, da das Ohr etwas abgeknickt wird. Ich fand den Beoplay sehr nicht zuletzt auf Grund des geringen Gewichtes (285g) sehr angenehm zu tragen.Das Noise-Cancelling ist auf hohem Niveau, wenn auch nicht Spitzenklasse. Rasenmähen mit einem Benzinmäher und Hörbuchhören war möglich, bei Musik drangen in dieser Extremsituation zu viele Störgeräusche durch. Im üblichen Stadtlärm dämpft es mehr als ausreichend, Musik hören auf der Rückbank unseres alten VW-Bullys war möglich, wenngleich ich hier schon wirkungsvollere Geräte hatte. Störend waren vor allem Windgeräusche, mit der der Beoplay manchmal überfordert schien. Der zum Vergleich zur Verfügung stehende Sennheiser Momentum 3 war hier effektiver, vielleicht nicht zuletzt vielleicht aufgrund der größeren Ohrmuscheln. Alles in Allem ist das ANC gut, aber nicht Spitzenklasse. Enervierend ist die zu empfindliche Trageerkennung. Selbst auf niedrigster Stufe stoppt sie beim Gehen sie Wiedergabe, obwohl der Hörer noch fest auf den Ohren sitzt. Hier hilft nur Abschalten.Wie klingt er nun: Zum direkten Vergleich durfte der B&O gegen den aktuellen Sennheiser Momentum 3 antreten. Die Klangeinstellung blieb auf neutral.Hier kann der Beoplay meiner Meinung nach punkten: Der Sennheiser trägt bei den Bässen eher dick auf. Der B&O gibt sich hier eher angenehm zurückhaltend. Der Bassbereich ist besser konturiert und deutlich straffer. Die Mitten sind gut durchhörbar, Stimmen haben ein angenehmes Timbre, und auch die höheren Lagen sind fein durchzeichnend und nie überzogen nervig. Im Vergleich mit dem Sennheiser ist der B&O insgesamt etwas kühler/ neutral abgestimmt. Beide klingen auf hohem Niveau. Letztlich ist die Abstimmung Geschmackssache. Dank der verlustfreien Bluetooth-Standards waren auch keine artifiziellen Störungen zu vernehmen, die mich bei Bluetooth früher nervten. Hat man sich einmal mit der etwas eigenwilligen Klangregelung angefreundet, bietet dieses einen weiten Bereich, den Klang an den individuellen Geschmack anzupassen und als Preset zu spreichern.Zuletzt muss man einfach die Akkulaufzeit loben: 35 Stunden sind kein leeres Werbeversprechen, der HX ist auch mit aktiviertem Noise-Cancelling ein echter Langläufer!

Ich liebe es wahrlich mit einem guten Kopfhörer auf den Ohren meine Lieblingsmusik genießen zu können und ich habe dazu in der Vergangenheit sicherlich eine ganze Menge guter bis sehr guter Erfahrungen mit eben guten und sehr guten Kopfhörern gemacht, aber im Segment der kabellosen Kopfhörer habe ich mit dem Beoplay HX meinen Meister gefunden.Und hiermit meine ich wirklich, dass Bang & Olufsen mit ihrem Beoplay HX wirklich ein Meisterstück kreiert haben, denn ich kann den Klang mit meinem fast doppelt so teuern kabelgebundenen Kopfhörer von der Konkurrenz vergleichen und doch wieder nicht, weil Beoplay HX allem die Krone aufsetzt.Der kristallklare Klang dieses superbequemen Premiumkopfhörers und seiner bis aufs letzte i-Tüpfelchen individualisieren Soundprofile toppt alles, was ich bisher ""gehört"" habe, wenn es um Kopfhörer ging.Noch dazu habe ich in der Vergangenheit mit Noise Canceling gemacht, die aber nicht daran kommt, was Beoplay liefert. Auch weiß ich jetzt, was es bedeutet die Musik zu hören und gleichzeitig aber seine Umwelt vollends wahrzunehmen,  denn auch hier spielt der Beoplay HX in der Profiliga und liegt dabei stundenlang einfach gut über den Ohren und drückt dabei nicht einmal leicht.Man spricht bei Bang & Olufsen von immersivem Sound und bitte meine Herren; ich kann mir diese Beschreibung zum Produkt nicht treffender vorstellen, denn diese Kopfhörer sind aus einer anderen Dimension. Wenn ich es nicht besser wüßte, würde ich ja sagen, dass Bang & Olufsen ein völlig neues, nie zuvor erlebtes Hörerlebnis ermöglicht und dies auch in Zukunft andere Hersteller versuchen wollen, denn der Beoplay HX stellt einfach alles in den Schatten, was zumindest ich persönlich bisher gehört habe!Was mich mitunter am meisten beeindruckt ist die Tatsache, dass ich bei meiner Lieblingsmusik wirklich jede Nuance heraushören kann, Instrumente, sämtliche Töne, Effekte...das Hörerlebnis war nie vorher so sehr ""direkt mittendrin"" wie mit diesen Kopfhörern. Per Knopfdruck kann man Die Welt mit diesen Noise Cancelling Kopfhörern völlig ausblenden, oder sie per Knopfdruck einfach wieder zuschalten und die Außenwelt wieder wahrnehmen. Dazu hat man an der linken Ohrmuschel einen kleinen Multi-Button.Wäre das nicht schon genug, steuert man die Lautstärke, den Skip zum nächsten oder letzten Song und eben auch die Soundisolierung, oder halt das Zuschalten aller Hintergrundgeräusche durch kleine Tasten direkt an Ohrmuschel, oder per Touch und Gesten über die Ohrmuschel selbst. Alles wunderbar perfekt und intuitiv gelöst!In Sachen Design und Haptik musste sich Bang & Olufsen ja ohnehin nie verstecken, aber auch hier setzt der Beoplay HX neue Maßstäbe, denn der Kopfhörer fühlt sich nicht nur großartig mit seinen leichten und angenehmen Materialien, sieht dabei blendend aus, sondern fühlt sich auch einfach nur großartig an!! Ein Designwunder, was man gerne in Händen hält, wenn man es denn dann mal vom Kopf nehmen will!!!!Selbst das von Bang und Olufsen beigelegte Case für die Kopfhörer hat echte Premium Qualität.Wenn es aber um das Quäntchen geht, was diesen Kopfhörer von vielen anderen seiner Art unterscheidet, dann ist dies die pure Ingenieurskunst und die Tatsache, wie hervorragend Soft und Hardware bei Bang und Olufsen zusammenspielen, denn nicht nur, dass der Beoplay HX schon von Hause aus mit einem hervorragenden Sound hardwaretechnisch ausgestattet ist, ist diese Hardware auf die eigenen Bedürfnisse nahezu punktgenau anpassbar, denn die B&O App macht dies möglich. Für mich das absolute Nonplusultra, was in heutigen Zeiten leider immer noch kaum einem Hersteller so klar zu sein scheint. Unverständlich! Hier holt Beoplay HX für mich das letzte raus!Ich höre meine Podcast im entsprechenden Soundprofil,was ich vorher etwas individualisiert habe, meine Musik im Optimum Profil und wenn es zum Workout geht, gibt es auch hierfür ein Soundprofil, was ich entsprechend angepasst habe. Und diese Anpassungen geschehen wirklich Punktgenau!!!Was gibt es noch zu sagen?Alles fühlt sich Premium an beim Beoplay HX, alle Tasten reagieren prompt, die Gestensteuerung läuft wie das heisse Messer durch die Butter und ich will diesen Kopfhörer gar nicht abnehmen.Was sich anfangs vielleicht etwas komisch anfühlen könnte ist, wenn man die Kopfhörer auf dem Kopf hat, ohne Musik abzuspielen, denn man spürt förmlich, wie Beoplay HX den Klang innerhalb der Muschel isoliert, denn die Außenwelt wirkt dann schon etwas steril abgeschottet! Aber, dieses Sounderlebnis will man ja, wenn man die Musik genießen will!Und das funktioniert ganz wunderbar mit einer Akkuladung für ca. 28 bis 30 Stunden, je nachdem wie viel man am und mit dem Kopfhörer und den Profilen spielt. Geladen ist der Kopfhörer auch binnen knapp 2 Stunden.Bluetooth funktioniert auch per Knopf und reagiert prompt, einmal gekoppelt muss ich mein iPhone nicht mehr anmelden und bin auch binnen weniger Sekunden wieder mitten im Song.Übrigens besitzt der Kopfhörer als zusätzliches Schmankerl sogar noch eine Standby Funktion, die intelligent erkennt, ob ich die Kopfhörer gerade trage, oder nicht. Nehme ich sie ab, gehen auch die Kopfhörer aus um, sobald sie wieder auf dem Kopf sitzen weiterzulaufen. Auch echt genial!!Ja, ich bin sehr parteiisch bei diesem Wundergerät, aber ich liebe es!! Jeder Musikliebhaber wird es mir sicherlich gleich tun, denn in der Preisklasse gibt es einfach nichts vergleichbar gutes, was so überzeugt!5 Sterne plus!!

B&O vient concurrencer les ténors que sont les casques Sony WH-1000M4 ou Bose NC 700 avec un tarif encore plus élitiste.Alors clairement tout respire le haut de gamme, à commencer par la housse rigide et son petit compartiment pour les fils qui offre une protection à toute épreuve. Il le faut bien tant le casque est lui-même d'une finition extrêmement qualitative : cuir d'agneau, mousse à mémoire de forme, alu brossé... irréprochable si ce n'est le rembourrage de l'arceau un peu ferme. Au final, le confort est vraiment très bon, particulièrement sur les oreilles et un port prolongé ne sera pas un problème.Comme pour tout casque bluetooth, il faut passer par une appli pour les réglages et la configuration. L'appairage se fait sans problème et le casque est vite reconnu bien que passer d'un appareil à un autre n'est pas bien géré... un peu pénible. L'appli est un peu lourde (74 Mo et des poussières) alors même que les menus sont peu nombreux : Quelques préréglages selon l'usage voulu, un équaliseur très bien fait (Beosonic), le réglage de l'ANC qu'il est possible d'affiner avec l'appli alors que sur le casque le bouton ne permet que de passer d'""activé"" à  ""transparence"" (je n'ai jamais vraiment compris l'intérêt de ce mode qui amplifie et déforme les bruits extérieurs) ou ""désactivé"" Quelques fonctions pas mal comme la détection de proximité qui met sur pause lorsqu'on retire le casque s'ajoute à une appli très ergonomique et épurée.Là où le bas blesse un peu c'est sur le tactile peu réactif et inutilement original : il faut parfois tapoter plusieurs fois pour mettre en pause quant au swipe rotatif pour monter ou baisser le volume, linéaire pour changer de plage, ce n'est pas vraiment une grande réussite ergonomique même si cela fonctionne globalement et c'est bien dommage pour des fonctions aussi essentielles -> une étoile en moins !Pour le reste la qualité audio est quasi parfaite : je teste toujours les casques et écouteurs avec le titre ""The league"" de Nasser, c'est un morceau électro qui fourmille de petits bruitages discrets, de basses et d'aigus bien distincts et d'une voix bien mise en avant. Ici c'est un sans faute, chaque détail est présent, l'ensemble est très clair et équilibré mais on peut envoyer plus de basses avec l'équaliseur si on aime le boum boum ! Le volume max n'est pas très élevé mais suffisant pour se faire quelques acouphènes si on aime... A noter qu'en filaire, le volume est encore plus maigre.Pour finir, la réduction de bruit active n'est pas aussi efficace que pour les meilleurs casques (j'entends encore un peu la frappe de mon clavier avec l'ANC réglé au max) mais n'occasionne aucun souffle et ça c'est le principal.Bilan : Un très très bon  et très cher casque, tout confort à la fois sonore et à porter mais avec une ergonomie (légèrement) agaçante.

Also ich muss sagen, dass das der beste Kopfhörer wäre, den ich je besessen habe.Warum das aber leider nicht so ist, erkläre ich im folgenden Text.Positiv:- Der Klang ist einfach genial. Ich hatte noch nie einen Kopfhörer, der so klar und gut geklungen hat. Die Bässe sind auch da, aber nicht zu dominant. Insgesamt ist das das Beste, was meine Ohren bisher hören durften.- Die Verarbeitung ist absolut spitze. Alles an dem Kopfhörer ist hochwertig verarbeitet und die Materialien fühlen sich auch hochwertig an. Für 500€ kann man das erwarten, aber einen derart hochwertigen Kopfhörer hatte ich bisher nie.- Man hat eine Hardcase Aufbewahrungstasche dabei, worin auch das USB- und das Klinkenkabel verstaut sind.- Die Active Noise Cancellation Funktion ist echt super und v.a. höre ich keinen Verlust beim Klang, wie man es bei anderen Kopfhörern oft hat. Ist es aktiviert, hört man von der Umgebung kaum noch etwas.- Der Akku hält sehr lange.- Er ist leicht und angenehm zu tragen.Negativ:- Die Ohrmuscheln dürften etwas größer sein. Meine Ohren werden nicht umschlossen, sondern die Ohrmuscheln liegen teilweise auf.- Jetzt der Hauptpunkt für meine Bewertung: TOUCHAlles muss heutzutage Touch haben. Im Auto gibt es immer mehr Touch und in anderen Bereichen auch. So auch hier bei dem Kopfhörer. Es gibt Bereiche, da machen Touchfunktionen Sinn und es gibt Bereiche, da ist es absolut fehl am Platz, so auch hier. Play und Pause geht noch mit einem einfachen Fingertippen auf die Ohrmuschel. Zum nächsten Lied springen oder zum vorherigen geht per Fingerwischen nach vorne oder hinten. Leider funktioniert das nicht immer. Oft pausiere ich, statt zum nächsten Lied zu springen und manchmal wische ich 5x nach vorne oder hinten und es passiert gar nichts. Ich schaffe es auch beim besten Willen nicht die Lautstärke per Touch anständig zu verändern. Nehme ich den Kopfhörer ab und sehe genau den Bereich, wo man im oder gegen den Uhrzeigersinn wischen muss, dann schaffe ich es wunderbar die Lautstärke zu verstellen. Habe ich den Kopfhörer aber auf dem Kopf, schaffe ich es nicht mehr. Manchmal klappt es und manchmal nicht. Man spürt einfach nicht, ob man jetzt den Finger da angesetzt hat, wo man die Lautstärke verstellen kann. Schafft man es dann doch die Lautstärke per Touch zu verstellen, dann ist das leider so ungenau, dass man selten genau die Lautstärke erreicht, die man gerne gehabt hätte. Ich stelle mich auch nicht zu doof an, denn ich habe es mehrere Personen testen lassen und die hatten alle die Probleme damit, die ich auch hatte. Das macht so keinen Sinn. Ich will die Lautstärke schnell und einfach verstellen können, was hier aber nicht möglich ist. Man hätte einfach 2 kleine Knöpfe oder ein Drehrad für die Lautstärke verwenden sollen und nicht die Touchfunktion, denn die funktioniert einfach nicht richtig.- Es liegt keine Anleitung bei, nur eine Kurzanleitung. Die ist aber wirklich sehr kurz. Ich weiß z.B. nicht, was dieser ""Multi-Button"" macht. Selbst auf der Homepage gibt es nur die Kurzanleitung.- Man kann sich eine App über einen QR Code in der Kurzanleitung herunterladen. Da wird von erweiterten Funktionen gesprochen. Ich habe sie heruntergeladen und installiert, weil ich dachte, dass da mehr erklärt wird etc. Nach der Installation wird man erst einmal aufgefordert sich bei Bang & Olufsen zu registrieren. Ich möchte mich nicht registrieren, um evtl. eine Anleitung zum Produkt zu erhalten oder mehr darüber zu erfahren. Wenn ich einen Kopfhörer kaufe, möchte ich damit Musik hören und mich nicht erst noch irgendwo registrieren.Ich finde es schade, dass der Eindruck eines derart super klingenden Kopfhörers durch die genannten Punkte getrübt wird. Für 500€ kann man aber wohl eine anständige Anleitung und Bedienung erwarten. Außerdem möchte ich mich nicht erst irgendwo registrieren, um meinen Kopfhörer zu konfigurieren und richtig nutzen zu können. Wer einen super Klang möchte und auf Touch steht, der ist hier genau richtig. Wer mit Touch an einem Kopfhörer nichts anfangen kann, ist hier falsch.

Queste cuffie Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX sono davvero il massimo in termini di confort e design, hanno uno stile davvero unico, suonano molto bene e hanno un'ottima cancellazione attiva del rumore, tuttavia, qualcosa non mi ha convito del tutto.Già dal packaging si intuisce l'alta qualità del prodotto, le cuffie arrivano all'interno di una confezione molto curata e minimale, la quale contiene:➡ la custodia delle cuffie;➡ le cuffie Beoplay HX già posizionate all'interno della custodia;➡ un cavetto USB-A/USB-C per la ricarica delle cuffie;➡ un cavetto jack da 3,5 mm;➡ una breve guida introduttiva e un foglietto con le dichiarazioni di conformità e le varie avvertenze.Le cuffie esteticamente si presentano davvero bene, esse sono realizzate con materiali di altissima qualità e hanno uno stile molto minimale e leggero.Complessivamente le cuffie sono poco ingombranti, leggere e non danno fastidio anche dopo averle indossate per molto tempo.Anche la confezione è poco ingombrante e molto maneggevole, può essere risposta in uno zaino senza occupare tropo spazio, inoltre anch'essa è molto leggera.Per quanto riguarda la qualità audio, posso dire che a mio avviso è ottima e in particolare ho apprezzato la qualità dei bassi.Queste cuffie permettono di apprezzare appieno tutti i suoni nei minimi dettagli, per questo suggerisco di utilizzare file audio di qualità non troppo compressi.La cancellazione del rumore funziona molto bene e si percepisce nettamente la differenza quando è attiva.Grazie alla cancellazione attiva del rumore, è possibile godersi la musica anche in ambienti con rumore di fondo fastidiosi, ad esempio in treno.L'app dedicata è davvero fatta bene, intuitiva e permette di personalizzare l'equalizzazione audio e altre impostazioni delle cuffie, come ad esempio la cancellazione attiva del rumore, la sensibilità dei sensori di prossimità, etc.La cosa che non mi è piaciuta è che al massimo volume e con alcuni settaggi audio a volte le cuffie si sentono un po' gracchiare e questo non va bene.Da premettere che stiamo parlando di un volume più alto di quello di ascolto medio e con un settaggio audio che aumenta ulteriormente i bassi, però per come la vedo io l'app non dovrebbe consentire di impostare una configurazione audio che distorce e compromette la qualità.Ad ogni modo, per questo motivo consiglio di mantenere la configurazione audio di default, in questo modo si evitano questi problemi.Il mio giudizio complessivo è abbastanza positivo perché ritengo sia un problema di equalizzazione, tuttavia per questo prezzo mi aspetterei delle cuffie perfette e queste, per via di quanto detto, non lo sono.

Cuffie che sono molto belle da vedere esteticamente, un design unico e con touchpad in alluminio sul padiglione per permettere il controllo della riproduzione musicale.All'interno della confezione si trova all'interno anche una custodia rigida per permettere di conservarle e portarle in giro senza farle rovinare, inoltre molto completa la confezione con i cavi usb per ricaricare le cuffie che si possono inserire all'interno della custodia.L'interfaccia tattile è molto reattiva ma la cosa che più sbalordisce è il suono limpido e pulito, si nota un audio professionale che permette di cancellare i rumori esterni, suono avvolgente e fa entrare davvero in un'atmosfera di relax, davvero un prodotto innovativo per chi ama la musica o vuole usare queste cuffie per lavoro.Per andare avanti o indietro con i brani occorre fare tutto in modo semplice e funzionale con un gesto sul padiglione esterno.Cosa che ho apprezzato è la funzione di cancellazione attiva del rumore ANC che si riesce ad attivare con un movimento dall'alto verso il basso, c'è inoltre anche la funzione Transparency Mode, cosa utile è che per vedere se le funzioni sono attive occorre vedere se la spia è accesa.La batteria dura davvero tanto e si ricarica in circa 2 ore per una ricarica completa, ho utilizzato le cuffie per una giornata senza problemi ed è stato davvero sorprendente il loro utilizzo , cosa che ho notato è che la batteria si può sostituire in futuro in completa autonomia ,quindi mi sembra davvero comoda questa funzione che ho notato anche se utilizzando frequentemente le cuffie non ho notato nessun problema e la batteria si ricarica con il cavo type c , tra l'altro molto presente sui nuovi dispositivi digitali.La cosa più caratteristica di queste cuffie è l'app BEOPLAY, dove si può ascoltare l'audio riprodotto con delle impostazioni personalizzate e sono presenti anche preset come ""rilassante"" ed ""emozionante"", davvero molto interessante.Il suono è molto nitido e ricco di definizione, grazie in particolare alla presenza del driver da 40mm e con impedenza di 24  Ω sono assicurati suoni senza distorsione.Il prezzo è abbastanza elevato ma si nota una qualità e una presenza di particolari che sono unici e sicuramente si tratta di un prodotto davvero professionale e da avere se si ama la musica o si vuole ascoltare la musica per produrre musica.

Hallo,habe lange überlegt was ich schreiben soll, ein Kopfhörer mit einer tollen Musikwiedergabe und einem wirklich gelungenen ANC, sogar telefonieren geht damit super.Nur leider gibt es da für mich einige erst mal den Kopfhörer selber betreffende Gründe des Unbehagens, hier z.B. die Sensortechnik die nicht wirklich immer und zuverlässig funktioniert, hier wären Sensortasten oder Taster vielleicht benutzerfreundlicher gewesen, auch die Ohrmuscheln selber könnten evtl. nicht jedem richtig passen, wobei ich selber keine Probleme damit hatte.Dann kommen wir zur Installation bzw. Einrichtung, diese ist sehr langwierig, auch die beigelegte Schnellanleitung war nicht sehr hilfreich, so macht man sich dann auf den Weg zur Bang und Olufsen Webseite. Hier findet man dann nach wieder etwas vergangener Zeit und Suche weitere Hilfe. Was schade ist das der Kopfhörer eine App erfordert, was auch schade ist ist die teils doch recht schwierige Bluetoothanbindung, aber hat man sich da dann durch gekämpft funktioniert alles soweit. Was ich auch merkwürdig fand, dass ich mir für einen Account bei Bang und Olufsen einrichten mußte.Nun ja, nun weiter zur Verarbeitung, hier ist wie ich finde alles in Ordnung, man findet tatsächlich keine Fehler und nichts wirkt irgendwie billig. Der Kopfhörer läßt sich gut anpassen und sitzt schön am Kopf, ist nicht zu schwer und das ANC leistet bei Umgebungsgeräuschen ganze Arbeit. Der Klang ist besser als bei allen anderen Kopfhörern die ich vorher hatte. Wer also besseren Klang möchte kann diesen hier bekommen.Als Fazit kann man sagen ein optisch und haptisch sehr gelungener Kopfhörer mit einem sehr gutem Klang, leider mit Abzügen in der B-Note wegen aufwendiger und langwieriger Installationsprozedur, und der teils nicht korrekt funktionierende Sensortasten, aber der Kopfhörer ist updatebar, vielleicht wird da ja zeitig für Abhilfe gesorgt. So wie jetzt kann ich allerdings nur wohlwollend 4 Sterne vergeben.

Den Beoplay HX merkt man vom ersten Moment an, dass sie absolut hochwertig sind. Öffnet man die Bang&Olufsen typische Verpackung, so findet man zunächst das Hartschalen-Transportcase. Dieses ist sehr edel und schön flach gehalten. Man fühlt regelrecht, dass man hierin die Kopfhörer sicher transportieren kann. In dem Case findet man neben den Kopfhörern (zu denen ich gleich komme) noch eine kleine Klappe hinter welcher die Kabel verstaut sind. Die Beoplay HX selbst sind qualitativ ebenfalls über jeden Zweifel erhaben! Ich hatte vor einigen Wochen die Apple Airpods Max, welche bis dahin die am besten verarbeiteten Kopfhörer waren, die ich je in den Händen hielt. Nun muss ich aber sagen, dass die HX hier nicht hinten anstehen. Ich würde sogar sagen, dass sie mir besser gefallen, da sie ebensogut verarbeitet sind, dabei aber etwas weniger klobig wirken und leichter sind, wodurch sie auch angenehmer zu tragen sind. Bei den Airpods Max (welche ich als direkten Konkurrenten sehen würde) hat mich auch sehr gestört, dass man sie nicht ausschalten kann. Klanglich fand ich sie auch ein wenig zu bassig und in den Höhen leicht zu zischelig (das ist nebenbei bemerkt bei den Max aber dabei Kritik auf sehr hohem Niveau!). Die HX sind hier über das Frequenzspektrum hinweg sehr neutral. Die Höhen sind leicht verhangen, hier würde ich mir etwas mehr Brillanz wünschen. Der Bass ist recht ausgewogen und detailliert mit einem Boost um 30Hz herum. Dadurch bekommt die Musik einen leichten Tiefbass-Boost, der aber zum Glück keine anderen Frequenzen überlagert. Die Mitten sind sehr klar und werden räumlich abgebildet. Gesang kommt wunderbar durch. Über die B&O App kann der Klang aber noch ein wenig angepasst werden. Ich würde mir zwar einen 10-Band-EQ wünschen, aber die App ist immer noch besser als nichts.Das ANC funktioniert super. Ohne Rauschen werden hier besonders tiefe Frequenzen rausgefiltert und mittlere sowie hohe Frequenzen stark gemindert. Auch der Transparenzmodus ist grandios und äußert realistisch. Hier sehe ich die Beoplay HX mit den Airpods Max fast auf einer Stufe.Die Akkulaufzeit ist mit über 25 Stunden ebenfalls absolut top.Preislich sind die HX sicherlich nicht günstig, jedoch bekommt man für sein Gels qualitativ einiges geboten und liegt trotzdem noch über 100€ unter den Apple-Kopfhörern. Zudem kommen sie im Gegensatz zu den Max mit einem super Hardcase, lassen sich ausschalten und per App im Klang regulieren. Bitte nicht falsch verstehen: Die Airpods Max sind wirklich absolut gute Kopfhörer, nur macht der Beoplay HX einige Dinge einfach besser bei ebenso tollem Klang. Von mir gibt es daher eine absolute Empfehlung.

Der Kopfhörer wird in einer stabilen Aufbewahrungsbox geliefert, in der es eine exakte Aussparung für die Kopfhörer, und ein verdecktes Fach für die beiden mit gelieferten Kabel, LINE IN (1,20 ) und Lade-USB (ebenfalls 1,20 m, USB-A- auf USB-C), gibt.Der Kopfhörer ist in drei verschiedenen Farben erhältlich (Anthrazit, Sand und Timber ) und besteht aus edlen Materialien (Metall [Aluminium?], Leder, Stoff). Er fühlt sich beim Auspacken zwar etwas schwer an, aber beim Tragen dann doch recht leicht (285 Gramm).Er trägt sich angenehm, der Bügel lässt sich verlängern und so an verschiedene Kopfformen anpassen, aber, es gibt immer ein Aber, nicht wahr? - die Ohrmuscheln sind zu klein und zu rund. Die meisten Menschen besitzen eben keine kugelrunde Ohrformen, sondern ovale, so dass diese runden Ohrmuscheln bei ihnen und auch bei mir nicht die Ohren umschließen, sondern auf ihnen aufliegen. Das führt nicht nur zu Hörverlusten, sondern ist bei längerem Gebrauch unangenehm schmerzhaft und führt auch zu starkem Schwitzen. Bereits nach ca einer halben Stunde kann ich schon richtige kleine Schweißseen auf ihnen sehen.Es liegt eine Quick-Start-Anweisung bei, die zunächst hoffen lässt, dass es auch eine ausführlicherer gebe. Nur ist das leider nicht der Fall. Es gibt einfach keine. Wer wirklich wissen will, wie sein teuer erworbenes Gerät funktioniert, muss sich durchs Internet wühlen oder die B&O Webseite befragen, aber auch dort steht nicht alles. Es gibt zwar eine ausführlichere Gebrauchsanweisung, die einem aber trotzdem nicht verrät, wozu der MF Knopf da wäre.Das erfuhr ich erst auf Anfrage (immerhin ist der Support schnell und freundlich). Hier die Antwort, was es mit der mysteriösen MF (Multi Funktion)-Taste auf sich hat: Diese ist dafür da, um den Sprachassistenten zu starten. Was aber nur dann funktioniert, wenn man die App geladen hat (zu der ich später noch kommen werde).Der Kopfhörer arbeitet mit Bluetooth 5.1, und verbindet sich schnell und problemlos, wenn auch nicht mit allen Geräten, was aber möglicherweise an denen liegen könnte.Weitere Funktionen am Kopfhörer selbst sind noch jener mysteriöse MF-Knopf und eine aktive, vierstufige, Geräuschunterdrückung (ANC – Active Noise Cancelling).Knopflos per Touch werden noch laut und leise, vor- und rückwärts, sowie Play/Pause am Kopfhörer selbst, bedient, alles aber eher umständlich und mit hohem Ärgerpotential, den Blutdruck zu steigern.Laut anderen Testberichten/B&O Webseite, wird ein effektiver Frequenzbereich von 20 bis 22.000 Hz bedient, und der Akku soll nach nur 20 Minuten Aufladen bis 35 Stunden halten, was ich bisher auch noch nicht ausgereizt habe.Ebenso soll der Akku wechselbar sein, nur konnte ich bisher nicht heraus  finden, wo er steckt und wie man ihn entnimmt.Ohne Aktionen schaltet der Kopfhörer nach 15 Minuten ab.Nun der Reihe nach zu den einzelnen Kritikpunkten:POSITIV:- Der Sound ist für meinen Geschmack sehr gut - warm, aber deutlich; ich kann plötzlich Instrumente hören, die ich mit anderen Kopfhörern nicht wahr nehme.- Die BT Übertragung ist hervorragend – auch im Nebenraum, sogar wenn dieser durch eine zweite Tür, da Flur dazwischen, getrennt ist. Kein Wackeln, keine Abbrüche, kein Rauschen,- und schnell und problemlos hergestellt.- Die verwendeten Materialein fühlen sich gut und wertig an.- Der Kopfhörer ist, bis auf die leidige Sache mit den Ohrmuscheln, angenehm zu tragen.- Die Möglichkeit, auch per Audiokabel verwendet werden zu können, ist praktisch.- Die BT Übertragung wird durch getätigte herein kommende Anrufe unterbrochen (allerdings nicht von alleine fort gesetzt)NEGATIV (und teilweise wirklich ärgerlich):- Die App. Nicht nur, dass die Unsitte, nicht alle Funktionen am Gerät selbst einstellen zu können, einfach nur nervt, ebenso die Tatsache, dass man sich registrieren muss, so funktioniert sie noch nicht einmal richtig.- Sie funktioniert nicht mit jeder Android Version. Unter 5.1 wurde sie noch nicht einmal im Store gefunden, unter 7.0 konnte ich sie zwar (sehr langsam) laden, die Verbindung zum Kopfhörer wurde auch hergestellt (BT), aber dann konnte der Menüpunkt „ Konfigurierung“ nicht aufgerufen werden.Mit Android 8.1 endlich klappte auch das Aufrufen der Konfigurierung, wenn auch diese selbst nicht so ganz. Ich kann zwar Klangbilder einstellen (Podcast, Musik, optimal, … die sich von einander nur kaum unterscheiden), aber die Lautstärkeregelung streikt.Die Einstellung des MF-Knopfes natürlich auch.- Da die App nicht (richtig) funktioniert, kann ich auch das Klangbild nicht ändern, was dazu führt, dass das Klangbild ""Telefon"" nicht eingestellt werden kann. Gesprächspartner klingen daher ausgesprochen dumpf, meine eigene Stimme wird ebenso empfunden.- Ergebnis: Die App lohnt nicht.- Es ist obendrein ärgerlich, dass sich diese Funktionen nicht am Kopfhörer selbst befinden. Die Klangregelung hätte sich locker, genau so wie die Lautstärkeregelung an der rechten Ohrmuschel, auf der linken unterbringen lassen, ebenso die Möglichkeit, verschiedene vorgegebene Klangbilder einzustellen (etwa mit Drücken der Mitte, so wie die Play/Pause Taste zB).- Nächster Punkt: die lästige, unzuverlässige Lautstärkeregelung durch Touch-  und Drehbewegungen an der rechten Kopfhörermuschel. Nichts gegen Touch, aber wenn man nicht sehen kann, was man tut, wird es schwer, besonders, wenn das Touchfeld flach ist und kaum tastbare Erhebungen aufweist, an denen man sich orientieren könnte.- Die Lautstärke wird durch Drehbewegungen geregelt. Es ist aber nicht angegeben, wo man ansetzen müsste. Die Ohrmuschel ist außen goldfarben und ziemlich mittig befindet sich ein schwarzer eingesetzter Kreis aus Kunststoff, der ganz leicht aufgeraut ist. Man regelt nun die Lautstärke, in dem man im Innenteil des Kreises die Drehbewegung ausführt, was mit mehr oder weniger Erfolg schon mal klappt. Meistens muss man sich plagen, um genau die Lautstärke zu erhalten, die man gerne hätte.- Vor- und rückwärts zwischen den Tracks erfolgt durch Hin- und Herbewegungen, die man aber ohne Hinsehen meistens mit der Lautstärkereglung verwechselt.- In der Mitte nun werden Pause/Play eingestellt. Auch diese Lösung leidet darunter, dass man nicht sehen kann und nicht fühlen kann, was man tut. Der Mittelpunkt wird daher eher zufällig als gezielt getroffen.- Hinzu kommt, dass trotz ansonsten guter und schneller BT Verbindung, ausgerechnet diese Taste nur sehr verzögert (länger als eine Sekunde) reagiert.Dh, man meint, man hätte noch nicht getroffen, drückt ein zweites Mal und unterbricht jetzt aber die Verbindung wieder, wenn man beide Male getroffen hätte.Bedaure, aber das ist eine selten dämliche Regelung.Fazit: Sehr guter Sound, angenehme Materialein, beinahe guter Tragekomfort, gutes BT.Leider ärgere ich mich echt über die Negativa (nicht viel sagender Quick-Start; unnötige und obendrein schlecht funktionierende App; unnötige, ärgerliche Registrierung, um an meine Adresse zu gelangen [ich will Musik hören, aber nicht ausspioniert werden], umständliche Bedienung; fehlende Funktionen am Kopfhörer selbst [wer will den ständig eine App anschmeißen, auch wenn sie mal funktionieren solle, um das Klangbild zu ändern?]).Wer die App nicht braucht, nur einen sehr guten Sound haben möchte (und kleine, runde Ohren besitzt), kann zugreifen. Allerdings erwarte wohl nicht nur ich bei dem Preis einfach ein funktionierendes Plug&Play nebst allen Bedienmöglichkeiten am Gerät selbst, und nicht erst tagelanges Suchen im Internet, zig Anfragen beim Support und dem ungutem Gefühl, für eine Adresssammlung missbraucht zu werden.Na, wenigstens ist der Support freundlich.

Die Bang&Olufsen Beoplay HX Kopfhörer wurden gut verpackt und direkt am nächsten Tag geliefert. Verpackt sind die Kopfhörer in einer praktischen Aufbewahrungshülle, welche sich mit einem Reißverschluss sanft öffnen und schließen lässt. Diese wird wiederum, zusammen mit einem Quick Start Guide und einer Anleitung, in einem ansehnlichen Pappkarton geliefert.Die Tasche ist natürlich nicht die kleinste, bietet aber aufgrund des Hartschalen Materials einen hohen Schutz. Für die Hörmuscheln ist eine extra Form „eingegossen“ wurden, sodass diese beim Transport nicht aneinander reiben können. Die Kopfhörer werden in der Tasche also sehr gut fixiert. Unter einem kleinen Deckel befindet sich das AUX zu AUX Kabel, sowie ein USB-C zu USB-A Aufladekabel.Die Kopfhörer fühlten sich schon beim ersten Mal in die Hand nehmen, außerordentlich hochwertig an. Hinsichtlich der Verarbeitungsqualität gibt es absolut nichts auszusetzen. Die ausfahrbare Schiene, mit der sich die Hörmuschel aus dem Bügel ziehen lässt, besteht komplett aus Aluminium. Das Verstellen der Hörmuschel geht also ganz leicht und ohne einen spürbaren Widerstand. Es gibt hierbei keine Raster, alles lässt sich individuell anpassen. Trotzdem halten die Hörmuscheln beim Tragen zuverlässig ihre eingestellte Position. Praktisch ist die dezente „Rechts“ und „Links“ Beschriftung im Inneren der Hörmuscheln. Diese sind ziemlich hilfreich, wenn die Kopfhörer noch neu sind und man sich noch nicht so wirklich auskennt. Mit dem Tragekomfort bin ich ebenfalls zufrieden. Der Bügel ist ordentlich gepolstert, sodass nichts auf dem Kopf drückt oder schmerzt. Die Hörmuscheln liegen zudem mit einem angenehmen Druck an den Ohren an und umschließen diese vollständig. Aufgrund des kompakten und filigranen Designs der Kopfhörer, sind diese zudem nicht besonders schwer. Und das trägt enorm zum Tragekomfort bei. So lassen sie sich ohne Probleme auch mal für eine längere Zeit am Stück tragen.Die Bedienung und Handhabung sind ziemlich intuitiv. Das Einrichten der Kopfhörer, zusammen mit meinem IPhone, war überhaupt kein Problem. Die Unterstützung von Apple Geräten verrät uns bereits der Schriftzug „Made for IPhone and IPad“, welcher auf die Umverpackung gedruckt ist. Nachdem Smartphone und Kopfhörer per Bluetooth gekoppelt wurden, verbinden sich die beiden Geräte nun sofort. Ähnlich wie das bei den Air Pods Pro der Fall ist. Eigentlich kann man jetzt schon anfangen, sich in das Sound Erlebnis zu stürzen. Es empfiehlt sich aber noch vorher die Bang&Olufsen App, welche sowohl für IOS als auch für Android verfügbar ist, herunterzuladen. Die App muss ebenfalls bei der ersten Verwendung mit den Kopfhörern gekoppelt werden. In der App lassen sich personalisierte Einstellungen treffen. So gibt es zum Beispiel einen Equalizer, welcher viele schon voreingestellte Szenarien beinhaltet. Natürlich lassen sich auch komplett eigene Equalizer erstellen und benennen. Obwohl sich die Lautstärke, sowie der Modus der Geräuscheunterdrückung, an den Kopfhörern selbst einstellen lässt, kann man diese Einstellungen auch in der App direkt vornehmen. Die Außenseite der rechten Hörmuschel ist Touch sensitiv. Hier lassen sich durch verschiedene Gesten Lieder wechseln, die Lautstärke einstellen, Musik pausieren, sowie Anrufe annehmen und auflegen. Das funktioniert alles wunderbar, wobei die Lautstärkeregelung anfangs ein wenig ungewohnt war. Um die Lautstärke anzupassen, wischt man in Viertelkreisen auf der Hörmuschel. Hierbei muss allerdings mehr Druck ausgeübt werden. Ansonsten reagieren die Kopfhörer nicht. Das hat zum Vorteil, das keine ungewollten Eingaben ausgeführt werden. An der linken Hörmuschel lässt sich der Grad der aktiven Geräuscheunterdrückung einstellen. Es gibt 3 Modi: Aktive Geräuscheunterdrückung, Normal Modus, Transparenz Modus. Mit der aktiven Geräuscheunterdrückung bin ich sehr zufrieden, da sie genau das macht, was sie soll. Sie ist vergleichbar gut, wie die der Air Pods Pro. Der Transparenz Modus empfiehlt sich dann, wenn man neben der Musik, alles um sich drum herum mitbekommen möchte. In der App lässt sich, neben einem automatischen Stand By Modus (Kopfhörer schalten nach 15min Nicht Benutzung automatisch aus), außerdem noch eine Trageerkennung aktivieren. Die Kopfhörer nehmen wahr, ob sie gerade getragen werden und pausieren die Musik, wenn sie abgenommen werden. Beim wieder aufsetzen spielt die Musik weiter. Die Hörmuscheln besitzen neben dem Ein/Aus/Bluetooth Paaring Knopf, noch einen Multi Button. Beim lange gedrückt halten, aktiviert sich bei Apple Geräten Siri. Ober er noch mehrere Funktionen beinhalt, wird leider nirgends beschrieben. Bei kurzem bzw. doppeltem Tippen auf den Knopf, passiert jedenfalls nichts. Deswegen gehe ich von keiner weiteren Funktion aus. Auf beiden Hörmuscheln sitzen noch ein paar Mikrofone, dessen Qualität ich bisher noch nicht Testen konnte. Des Weiteren ist in der rechten Hörmuschel ein AUX, sowie USB-C Port verbaut. Ein AUX sowie USB-C Kabel liegen dem Lieferumfang, wie schon erwähnt, bei. Auf einen entsprechenden 5V Adapter muss man leider verzichten, wobei den die allermeisten schon besitzen. Das Aufladen geht recht zügig. Die Akkulaufzeit wurde aber ein bisschen „aufgehübscht“, oder sie wurde bei sehr geringer Lautstärke gemessen. Denn nach einer halben Stunde Musik hören, waren schon 30% Batteriekapazität weg. Man muss aber auch dazu erwähnen, das ich basslastige Musik auf etwa 8/10 der Lautstärke gehört habe. Da die Produktbeschreibung allerdings eine maximale Wiedergabezeit von 30 Stunden verspricht, hat ich hinsichtlich der Akkulaufzeit etwas mehr erwartet. Aber gut, schlecht ist die Akkulaufzeit definitiv nicht.Ich habe in meinem Leben noch nicht viele preisintensivere Kopfhörer besessen. Um genau zu sein, besitze ich die Sony Over Ear Kopfhörer (ca. 130€) und die Apple Air Pods Pro. Die Bang&Olufsen liegen hinsichtlich der Soundqualität klar vorn. Falls man am Anfang noch nicht vom Sound überzeugt sein sollte, empfiehlt es sich unbedingt die App herunterzuladen und dort die Equalizer auszuprobieren. Denn diese beeinflussen das Hörerlebnis sehr. Die Musik ist über alle Bereiche hinweg glasklar. Wenn also der Bass einsetzt, brechen die Kopfhörer nicht ein und verschlingen keine Töne. Dies ist auch bei voller Lautstärke der Fall. Wobei man da mit dem Bass aufpassen muss. Wenn dieser auf Anschlag eingestellt ist, kann man logischerweise nicht mehr auf der höchsten Lautstärke hören, da auch diese Kopfhörer an ihre Grenzen stoßen. Da kommen wir auch schon zu einer wichtigen Feststellung. Und zwar sind eventuelle Bass Liebhaber nicht unbedingt bestens mit diesen Kopfhörern beraten. In den Mitten und Höhen sind sie wie schon gesagt perfekt und auch in den Tiefen haben sie einiges an Kraft. Jedoch könnte in diesem Bereich, für meinen Geschmack etwas mehr gehen. Die 130€ Sony Kopfhörer können, was den Bass angeht, fast mithalten. Jedoch sind sie natürlich in den Mitten und Höhen, sowie der generellen Lautstärke, klar unterlegen. Ich möchte den Bang& Olufen Kopfhörern hiermit keinesfalls den Wert absprechen. Aber es ist glaube ich wichtig zu wissen, das die Kopfhörer nicht unbedingt bestens für Bassliebhaber geeignet sind.Abschließend möchte ich nochmal erwähnen, das die Bang&Olufsen Kopfhörer ihr Geld wert sind. Sie sind absolut hochwertig verarbeitet, besitzen eine intuitive Steuerung (mit App) und bieten einen hohen Tragekomfort. Das Musikeerlebnis ist jedes Mal auf‘s neue ein Vergnügen. Nur an Bass fehlt es ein kleines Quäntchen, was den allermeisten aber garnicht fehlen wird.

Selten habe ich mich mit einer Bewertung so schwergetan, wie bei diesen Kopfhörern.Einerseits ist der Klang genial, andererseits nerven einige Dinge aber schon sehr. Möglicherweise liegt es auch daran, dass ich keine ausgesprochene Technik – Liebhaberin bin.Wozu brauche ich bei einem Kopfhörer eine App? Ich benutze seit 40 Jahren Kopfhörer, eine App war da nie von Nöten.Ich bin hin – und hergerissen von 5 Sternen für den brillanten Klang und 2 Sternen wegen teilweise nerviger Bedienung.Positiv:Natürlich ist da der brillante Klang. Seit 40 Jahren benutze ich Kopfhörer von SENNHEISER und war immer zufrieden. Der Klang dieses Kopfhörers ist nicht besser, aber absolute Spitzenklasse.Bässe, Höhen, Tiefen…alles kommt in einer fantastischen Soundqualität herüber.Das Tragegefühl ist recht angenehm. Die Ohrmuscheln sind nicht zu klein und liegen sehr gut an.Die Qualität ist über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Das erwarte ich von diesem Preis aber auch. Ich möchte nicht 500 € zahlen und nach einem Jahr sind die Ohrmuscheln „abgewetzt“.Neutral:Die App. Ich verstehe es immer noch nicht, aber egal.Die Verbindung per Bluetooth ist dagegen natürlich notwendig und funktioniert sauber und störungsfrei.Ein wenig nervend sind diese Touch – Tasten. Aber das ist wohl auch wieder Geschmackssache. Ich finde sie ungenau und frage mich, wie lange diese Funktion hält.Negative Dinge gibt es nicht und ich kann auch zur Technik wenig Neues beitragen.Für mich muss ein Kopfhörer einen tollen Klang haben und einen bequemen Sitz der Ohrmuscheln.4 Sterne.

Bang et Olufsen... la fameuse marque qui depuis des décennies mise autant voire plus sur l'esthétique de ses produits que sur leurs qualités audiophiles. Quand j'étais ado, arrivé chez un copain dont les parents avaient une chaine B&O signalait presque à coup sûr qu'ils n'y connaissaient rien en musique mais souhaitaient impressionner leurs visiteurs !Jugement injuste. B&O a aussi créé des produits excellents, mariant une esthétique un peu surannée à de vraies qualités audiophiles.Ce casque en est un exemple parfait. Je le dis tout de suite : je le trouve beaucoup trop cher. On paye la marque, on paye le design hyper-soigné et aussi des parti-pris techniques pas forcément aboutis, comme les surfaces tactiles qui permettent entre autre de régler le son sur les oreillettes. Au début, ça ne marche pas toujours, c'est capricieux. Et puis on s'habitue, on découvre et on acquiert les bons gestes, et là ça devient vraiment une expérience de qualité. Et c'est tellement pratique, de ne pas avoir à ressortir le smartphone de la poche.Je trouve l'ANC très efficace pour un casque de ce genre, je n'ai pas pris le métro avec cela dit, mais en balade en ville on se sent bien isolé, trop même parfois, quand il s'agit de faire attention au trafic.la qualité de construction est irréprochable dans les moindre détail, ça respire le haut de gamme par toutes les matières, tous les joints, un vrai plaisir. La conception de l'arceau le rend très agréable à porter, on l'endure des heures sans gêne.Et le son : eh bien c'est la surprise pour moi, il est vraiment très bon ! L'application permet de l'optimiser mais le réglage par défaut est déjà parfait : équilibre, profondeur, étagement des plans sonores, courbe de réponse sans bosses évidentes, c'est quasiment un Beyer Dynamic DT990, mais sans fil et doté d'une fonction micro et prise d'appel ! Cinq étoiles, malgré son prix astronomique. Si vous avez les moyens, c'est un excellent choix. Et il a une sacré ""gueule"" !

PREMESSA :sono molto appassionato di prodotti audio e sono sempre alla ricerca di buone cuffie cablate o wireless per ascoltare musica.Provo a darvi le mie valutazioni secondo questa scaletta che solitamente utilizzo:INDOSSABILITA' --> queste cuffie pesano 287 grammi e certamente non sono le più leggere in circolazione però, con i padiglioni in memory-foam di pelle di agnello, le ho trovate confortevoli anche per sessioni prolungate (almeno 3/4 h) , l’archetto superiore è ben imbottito e la pressione verso i padiglioni auricolari è giusta : promosse per comodità.COMANDI --> in queste cuffie c’è una superfice touch sul lato dx con cui è possibile controllare tutto con degli “swipes” : skip avanti, indietro, assistente vocale, ANC, Ambient sound, play, pausa, rispondi/chiudi il telefono ed il controllo volume : ottime da questo punto di vista. Avrei apprezzato molto una voce-prompt che avvisa quando l’ANC e l’ambient-sound è attivo ma purtroppo manca..BATTERIA --> impossibile scaricarle, durata della batteria perché 35h con ANC attivo, diventano anche 40h senza ANC.QUALITA' COSTRUTTIVA --> direi Premium, considerate che sono Bluetooth V5.1 e sono abilitate ai codec Aptx HD e  Aptx Adaptive per utenti Android ed AAC per gli utenti Iphone per uno streaming ad alto bit-rate, hanno tutte le finiture in pelle ed alluminio, nella confezione c’è anche un cavo per l’ascolto della musica “cablata” con il jack da 3,5mm. Purtroppo non possono essere ripiegate per ridurre gli ingombri all’interno della custodia rigida che è presente in confezione (abbastanza grossa ho postato le foto con un altro case per darvi un’idea). E’ inoltre disponibile un APP da scaricare sul playstore con cui è possibile personalizzare/equalizzare la nostra musica. La funzione ANC abbatte circa il 75/80% dei rumori a bassa frequenza ( SONY arriva al 90%) e la funzione Ambient Sound è sviluppata bene ed i suoni che vengono raccolti risultano naturali ..segnalo però che ho sentito un po' di “rumore bianco” quando questa è attiva.QUALITA' DEL SUONO --> qui ragazzi c’è il vero motivo per cui acquistare queste cuffie : se amate i bassi queste cuffie li hanno potenti e profondi quando il brano lo richiede, le frequenze medie sono rappresentate in modo preciso ed incredibilmente dettagliato (voci femminili e strumenti), quelle alte sono brillanti : per i miei gusti è un sound fantastico, ho avuto la sensazione che fossero cablate..SOUNDSTAGE--> la sensazione è quella di stare in una ambiente ambio, sembra di stare in una sala concerti di taglia grande in cui i suoni arrivano da più direzioni e senza perdita di dettagliPRO • Sound grandioso e, per quanto possibile, comparabile a cuffie cablate• ANC e Ambient Sound implementati molto bene• Cura costruttiva e dei materiali• APP che consente ampia personalizzazione delle cuffie (anche per futuri aggiornamenti software)• Sono multipoint ( possibile restare collegati a 2 device contemporaneamente)CONTRO • Prezzo di 499,€ al momento della recensioneCONCLUSIONI --> da un brand come Beng & Olufsen avevo delle aspettative molto alte che onestamente sono state rispettate. Mi rendo conto che il prezzo di acquisto non è molto abbordabile però, ho ascoltato dei brani Jazz dove sono riuscito a cogliere sfumature che solo le cuffie cablate mi permettevano di sentire : se avete il budget per acquistarle : consigliate al 100%Mi permetto un Suggerimento : fatele suonare per 15/30 minuti a “vuoto” prima di giudicarle, passato questo tempo direi che sono pronte per l’utilizzoSpero di essere stato d’aiuto

Are these worth £450? No, I don't think so. You're paying a big brand premium here.Sure, the sound quality is first class - easily as good as my Bose headphones. But it's the high cost that's offputting.If you're buying these for the ANC, my advice is to test them out in person before buying. The ANC has been disappointing on every single pair of headphones I've tried, even expensive ones like these.These are very lightweight, surprisingly so, which adds to their comfort.35 hours of battery life is pretty decent.Overall, I could only recommend these to dedicated B&O fans, due to the extremely high price.

Certes, le prix peut décourager beaucoup de monde, à juste titre sans doute, mais ce casque de la prestigieuse marque Bang & Olufsen ne démérite jamais et reste fidèle à la réputation sans faille de la marque.Tout, dans ce casque, respire le haut de gamme et le sérieux de fabrication, sans même parler de la qualité des matériaux de fabrication, irréprochable elle aussi. C'est un marché où la concurrence est rude, mais B&O relève le défi sans broncher le moins du monde.Le confort du produit est vraiment impressionnant ; c'est certainement le casque le plus confortable que j'ai porté dans toute ma vie. Il ne donne pas mal à la tête.L'appairage et l'autonomie sont parfaits.L'équilibre entre suppression du bruit ambiant et qualité du son (le défi le plus difficile à relever) est à mon humble avis presque parfait. L'A.N.C. fait très bien son travail, et ce sans endommager ce que vous écouter. N'oubliez pas que la marque a pour fer de lance la HIFI (même si les fichiers MP3 n'en sont pas). Le son est magnifique, ample et très dynamique.B&O fait dans le prémium avec talent, comme toujours.

As soon as you take the Beoplay HX headphones out of the case the build quality is evident. As expected from B&O, the materials look and feel fantastic, the aluminium solid, etching precise, the design is minimalist, simultaneously classic and modern, very high end. The pads sit comfortably over the ears and, together with the padded headband, facilitate a pleasant listening experience for extended periods. Battery life is excellent, even with ANC on, and the headphones have proximity detection so that audio stops when they are removed.The sound is clear and well defined, balanced and neutral. Bass response is deep without overpowering, each note precise; mids and highs are clear and bright with lots of space and dynamics. The HXs cope well with dance music sub-basses, busy metal and jazz, acoustic guitars, brass; really whatever you throw at them, with a clarity and separation, a directness, which is really impressive.ANC performance is good and there is little noticeable affect on the audio when switching between ANC and transparency modes. Switching is done from a button on the left unit which also has a multi-function button which can be used for voice assistant. The right unit houses the power button, and sockets for USB-C charging and 3.5mm audio cable (which apparently only works when the headphones are charged, although I suspect many, like me, will rarely use it). The right side also has touch controls for play/pause, skip track and volume (a circular motion which is a little quirky but works fine, once you get used to it). My over-ear headphones of choice for the last few years have been Sony WH-1000XM3 which have fantastic noise cancelling performance. The B&Os are close to matching the Sonys, not quite, but close. However, in every other respect it would appear to be time to retire the Sonys, which suddenly feel very plasticky.The companion app is also minimalist, comprising sliders for column and ANC, and a grid containing five sound presets and a selector to create others. You can have many presets although only five will appear on the grid, the others hidden; I suspect five will be sufficient.These headphones are very expensive but they are quality. I have a B&O hifi system which is at least 30 years old and it still performs superbly. I suspect the HX headphones may well be long-serving and so the metric moves from cost to value and I believe these headphones deliver value.

C'est un casque audio sans fil avec réduction du bruit, de la marque danoise Bang & Olufsen, réputée pour la qualité de ses produits audios.Il est de type circum-auriculaire.Un étui rigide est fourni pour le rangement et le transport.Il se connecte via Bluetooth, mais on a aussi la possibilité de se connecter via un câble Jack classique, ce qui est pratique pour une utilisation avec un vieil appareil ne disposant pas du Bluetooth. Le casque prend en charge le Bluetooth Multipoint, on peut ainsi connecter deux appareils en même temps.Il est très léger et confortable, même après avoir été porté pendant de longues heures. Ses coussinets en mousse à mémoire de forme recouverts de cuir y sont pour quelque chose.On peut l'utiliser pour faire des appels audio (il est muni de plusieurs micros) ou des visioconférences.La qualité sonore est excellente, que ce soit les aigus ou bien les graves, on est vraiment dans du haut de gamme. La fonction pour la réduction de bruit fonctionne aussi sans heurt et est vraiment efficace.

Me ha parecido sublime la calidad que poseen estos auriculares de Bang&Olufsen. Es la primera vez en mi vida que tengo la oportunidad de probar unos auriculares de esta marca, y digo con toda la certeza del mundo que son los mejores auriculares que he probado.Desde el mismo momento que te llega, se nota una calidad y unos acabados que las marcas normales de auriculares no tienen, Siendo una caja realmente bonita, muy sencilla y teniendo una experiencia de desempaquetado muy buena, digna de unos auriculares de gama alta como son en esta ocasión. Una presentación sencilla, y nada más abrir la caja nos encontramos con una muy buena funda protectora rígida, con los auriculares y sus accesorios en su interior.Lo primero que notas nada más sacarlos de su bolsa es la calidad de acabados que tiene. Según huele y he leído a posteriori en sus especificaciones, es que están hechos de piel de cordero, además de espuma con memoria, por lo que son verdaderamente cómodos de poner. Una vez que te los pones hasta apagados, lo que notas es que su cancelación de ruido es absoluta.Una vez los enciendes, la tecnología de cancelación activa de ruido es absoluta. Cuentan con Bluetooth 5.1, altavoces de 40mm con imanes de neodimio, USB-C, entre otras características. Pero por supuesto lo más importante y lo mejor, además de sus acabados, es la calidad de sonido que tiene.Espectacular. Sin palabras me deja cada vez que utilizo estos auriculares. No he necesitado bajarme ninguna aplicación complementaria para utilizarlos. Su calidad de sonido, volumen, cuerpo, bajos, medios.... todo. Son un 10 en mi opinión, parece como que no hubiese estado escuchando esta música y todas sean nuevas para mí. Y eso que lo he utilizado con el Bluetooth de mi móvil. Cuando lo he conectado a mi PC gracias al cable que incluye Jack, la experiencia ha sido más que satisfactoria.Cuenta con botones en la parte inferior de los auriculares, para controlar el volumen, apagarlos y encenderlos y poner el modo cancelación de ruido, el cual es sorprendente. Los click, los botones y absolutamente todo está acabado perfectamente.No son unos auriculares económicos, pero son unos auriculares absolutamente TOP. Quien quiera lo mejor, esta es su opción.

The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX Headphones (Model# 1224000) are a set of top-of-the-range high-end headphones delivering proper audiophile sound quality.I’m not going to deliver chapter and verse about Bang & Olufsen and the highly-respected quality of their products. If you’ve found this listing, if you’re reading these reviews, then you no doubt already know all about B&O. So, let’s get straight on with the headphones at hand.They arrive in a stylishly sleek and understated box which echoes the overall ethos of the brand. Nothing showy. It’s all about the sound. All about the quality. Precision. Attention to every detail. Beautifully, classically, stylishly understated.Inside the box you have the headphones, a zip-close hard carrying case, and the usual charging leads and instruction manuals.Set up of the headphones is an absolute doddle. It’s the usual Bluetooth pairing where you’ll need to press and hold the pairing button on the headphones then go into Bluetooth setting on your device and select “Beoplay” to pair. That’s it.You can also download the Bang & Olufsen App on your phone (or whatever) so you can change the “listening modes” and play with the sound equalisation etc of the headphones via that app.  Trust me, this is absolutely worth it and really does enhance the overall listening experience with the headphones by adjusting to your surrounding etc.Anyway, with everything set up and linked and fully charged blah blah blah…what are the darn headphones like? Well, quite simply, they’re the absolute nuts.  The noise cancelling is as good as if not better than Bose noise cancelling.  There’s absolutely no bleeding of the outside world into your self-created audio bubble. Just you and whatever you’re listing to. Just perfect.The sound reproduction is breath-taking. Acoustic notes are natural, full of blood and soul. Acoustic guitars sing with a thick and full sound that warms the heart. Electric guitars sound like a chugging, powerful force of will. Live performances are raw and crisp. Mastered albums show the layers, the depth of the songs.Bass isn’t supped up like the kids these days love. Instead it’s true to the records. Thick, bold, deep and rooting the songs to the floor.Every note is discernible. Every layer can been heard, listened into, identified and enjoyed. Like a aged single malt, songs can be enjoyed for the sheer beauty of their many layers. The complexities. And the love of sound.The headphones deliver up to 30 hours of playtime. Yeah, you read that right. Although with the active noise cancelling and the volume up a bit etc, this probably won’t make 30 hours. Nevertheless, anything in that sort of region is damn impressive.All in all I can quite happily say these are now my favourite headphones. I have Bose, Sennheiser, Sony, and Phillips sets.  These though. These are spectacular. Just love the sound. Love it.

Die Kopfhörer wurden sehr schnell geliefert und kamen gut verpackt und unbeschädigt bei mir an. Schon beim Auspacken merkt man, dass es sich hierbei um ein hochwertiges Produkt handelt. Die Verpackung ist ähnlich wie bei Apple Produkten ein sehr stabiler hochwertiger Karton. Innen befindet sich die Tasche inklusive der Over-Ear Kopfhörer. In der Tasche ist auch ein extra Fach für die Kabel enthalten.Einen Vergleich mit ähnlichem Kopfhörern habe ich leider nicht. Bis jetzt habe ich keine AirPods von Apple immer genutzt und war der Meinung, dass der klang hier schon sehr gut ist.Das ist aber kein Vergleich mit diesem Produkt hier. Die Verarbeitung der Kopfhörer ist tadellos.Das Paaren  über Bluetooth ging auch sehr einfach, hierfür gibt es auch eine extra App. In dieser kann man dann auch die Höhen und Tiefen und auch den Bass individuell steuern. Und das war eine Funktion, die mich wirklich überrascht hat.Auch das Noise cancelling habe ich in der Art bis jetzt bei Kopfhörern noch nicht erlebt. Schon beim normalen aufsetzen ohne Musik hört kein sein Umfeld nur noch gedämpft.Die Kopfhörer sitzen perfekt ohne auch nach stundenlangen Tragen unangenehm zu werden.Noch nie habe ich meine Musik so intensiv wahrgenommen und mittendrin miterlebt.Und als wäre das noch nicht genug, setzt Bang&Olufsen noch einen drauf und man kann über Touch seine Musik steuern. So geht es einzustellen, ob man es lauter oder leiser möchte oder man kann pausieren aber auch zum nächsten Lied wechseln.Sobald man während des Musik Hörens die Kopfhörer abnimmt, pausieren sie automatisch. Und wenn man sie wieder aufsetzt, spielt sie dort weiter, wo sie aufgehört hat.Der Preis mag zunächst etwas hoch erscheinen, aber die Qualität ist es definitiv wert. Für vergleichbare Produkte anderer Hersteller zahlt man mindestens den selben Preis.Die Qualität hat mich hier vollkommen überzeugt. Daher gebe ich auch 5 Sterne.

This is one heck of a set of headphones. They are very high quality - but at this pricpoint you should expect nothing less. They come very well packaged and presented in a cardboard box. Inside the box you will find a black zipper case which contain the headphones, charging lead and separate 3.5mm audio lead. Also a printed card with quick setup instructions.Upon opening the zipper case, the headphones are first revealed and they look beautiful. They are quite lightweight but very well made. Only thing I do not like at this point is the large L & R which is printed inside the ear cups. This I find really cheapens the look.The left cup has the following buttons:• Active Noise Cancelling / Transparency Button• Multi Button (Which I am struggling to find the use of)The right cup has the following buttons:• Power button (Short press on/off and long press Bluetooth Pairing)• USB input for charging• 3.5mm Audio Line in socket.Also on the right ear cup is the gesture area where you can control play/pause, Next / previous track and Volume up/down by simply tapping or swiping in the desired direction.The Quick Start guide prompts you to download the Bang & Olufsen app. Not a problem to download (it is 74MB from the app store). Once downloaded you will have to create a B&O account, which I did. However, all attempts so far to get the app to recognise the headphones has proven impossible. I have uninstalled the app, reinstalled the app - nothing. Despite being connected to my phone via bluetooth, every attempt to link the headphones to the app returns a ""Unable to find Beoplay"" error. Very frustrating indeed.So, it was left for me to test the headphones by running my usual music app on my phone.First time of wearing the headphones I was struck by how soft and comfortable the lambs skin and memory foam cups are really good. No issues with wearing these for extended periods.Sound quality is exquisite. Very clear with very little equalisation required. The really sound remarkable. The ANC/Transparency button is easy to find while wearing and a quick press results in changes to the mode. However, there is no audible confirmation of this to let you know which mode you are currently in. No biggie for me as the ANC is actually adaptive so adjusts itself depending on your surroundings.Battery life is excellent too. A boasted 40 hours of play time with a bluetooth connection alone, and 35 hours with ANC in operation. I have been listening off and on for well in excess of 30 hours now and they are still going strong. Charging is easy and convenient too by means of the supplied USB-C cable.I have dropped a single start from this review simply for the problems I am having with the dedicated Bang & Olufsen app. If you are paying this much for a set of what are truly superb headphones, then you should be able to rely on the dedicated app which is made by the same company especially for this set of headphones.Other than that I simply can no fault them. They really are the best I've ever had the pleasure of owning, and I do also have £400+ sets to compare them with.

My first ever B&O headphones, “built for comfort” says the blurb, oh and they are very, very comfortable, so on that front they’re off to a good start.There’s no doubt that these are exceptionally well built, aluminium cups and headband, soft memory foam pads surrounded in lambskin - these are exceptionally comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend them for exercise however, as they don’t clamp too tightly so regular head movements would cause slippage and the pads (though comfy) are not massively breathable so ears could get sweaty. The underside of the headband has fabric padding with shaping to rest comfortably on the head.Sound is excellent and customisable with the B&O app - a ‘dial’ which tells you what you are altering when you move it around (reduced treble, increased bass, etc).ANC is decent and performs best in ‘static’ environments where there is a constant noise (so on the train/bus, in an office etc) it seems to struggle where noise is infrequent (so near a road without much traffic - the ambience is handled well but the intrusion of a vehicle passing is not reduced as much) and in windy environments you do get the wind noise as it hits the ANC mics (not massively but enough to distract). The level of ANC is also customisable in the app.There is also a hear through mode (again, customisable in the app) which works well - one button to cycle through ANC, hear through or neutral.Controls take a bit of practise to get used to. The right cup is touch sensitive - a tap will play/pause/answer whereas a horizontal swipe back or forth with skip/back track. Volume is controlled by a circular motion - clockwise to increase and anti clockwise to decrease. It’s the volume that takes the most practise but if I’m honest it’s really tricky to pull off. Sometimes it’s hyper sensitive, other times seems to ignore you.To be fair - touch controls with virtually every headphone are hit and miss, some are better than others and these are fine in the grand scheme of things.The hard shell case is really nice too, and there is a hidden compartment for the 3.5mm aux cable and USB C charging cable. 30 hours battery with ANC on? That’s about right - from a full charge I got just over 31 hours at 60% volume.If you want premium headphones that sound great, have good ANC and are exceptionally comfortable these will do it, so long as your not wanting to use them for exercise or outside in the wind.If you want a pair for exercising, or out and about these won’t be for you.

Bang & Olufsen es una marca de referencia en el mercado audiovisual. Tengo varios productos y su calidad en el sonido es impresionante.En este caso, son unos auriculares bluetooth increíbles, no solo por su calidad sino también por la comodidad de llevarlos puestos, gracias a su diadema y almohadillas.Además, destaco de ellos lo siguiente:- Sonido Hifi de alta calidad, con espectaculares graves, medios y agudos.- Totalmente configurables con la app Bang & Olufsen.- Espectacular cancelación de ruido, tanto por la almohadilla que tapa muy bien las orejas como pon la cancelación de ruido activa que anula todos los ruidos exteriores.- Duración de la batería de 30 horas, algo menor cuando usas la cancelación de ruido.- Conexión ultra rápida con tu dispositivo una vez ya han sido emparejados.- Son súper cómodos. La calidad de acabado hace que al ponértelos todo sea suavidad, además de ser ligeros.- Incluye una funda, un cable de audio micro Jack 3,5mm y otro cable de carga tipo Ubs-C.En resumen. Es tan grande su calidad de sonido que la única de explicar como suenan es probarlos.Si buscas unos auriculares de gran calidad, no lo dudes.

Commençons par les points positifs, l'emballage du casque est très beau, la sacoche très solide et le casque en lui même respire la qualité.Puis, on installe l'application Bang & Olufsen. Ca prend un certain temps, ce n'est pas fluide, il faut s'enregistrer, mais  il y a des confusions avec le compte google, déjà, ça m'ennuie profondément que ça ne soit pas fluide.Bon, l'appairage bluetooth se fait plus facilement qu'avec l'appli, c'est déjà ça. Et après le son. Il est très bon, bien dans le détail, c'est vrai que c'est très plaisant... mais de là à y mettre ce prix, je ne suis pas sûr. Déjà parce que ce casque est prévu pour les smartphones. Il est bluetooth et le jack qui est fourni ne permet pas de le brancher sur une chaîne hifi. Alors bon, quand bien même on aurait des fichiers FLACS ou WAVES sur son smartphone, il ne s'agira jamais de la meilleur source sonore. Du coup, est-ce que ça vaut le coup d'investir autant, quand des intra auriculaires font un boulot presque équivalent pour deux fois moins cher ? D'autant que je trouve que l'écoute est fatigante au bout d'un certain moment.Alors oui, il y a le prestige de la marque, ça en jette. Mais à part ça, je reste perpexe. Pourquoi n'avoir pas fourni un jack long 6.35 ? Cela fait un peu pingre !Bref, pour les inconditionnels de la marque...

I've never used B&O headphones before but my dad's car has some of their speakers and they are excellent from what he says, my expectations for these headphones were very high and I would say they only just met them.Let's start off with the build quality, they are extremely well made, there is a single bit of plastic to be seen on the outside, it is all aluminium, leather, and fabric, they clearly did not cheap out on the materials with these headphones, very impressed.So how comfortable are they?...Very!I couldn't name you any wireless headphones more comfortable than these, I can wear them for hours without feeling any pain on my ears, I am a little annoyed there's no markings to indicate how open the headphones are when you pull them out of the headband, although this is standard at this point.The earcups are foam inside and leather on the outside, I'm not usually a fan of leather earcups but these weren't bad at all, my ears usually get very sweaty in leather earcups and they still did in these, but noticably less compared to headsets like the Jabra Evolve2 85.A common issue with headphones is how tight they grip onto your head, I've used headphones with a similar-ish design to these and the main issue with the comfort was how tight they were, thankfully with these ones properly adjusted they feel absolutely perfect, not too much or too little pressure, just perfect to keep them on your head without causing pain.Before we get onto sound quality, I want to talk a bit about the touch panel on the right earcup.If you don't know, the right earcup is touch responsive and will react to gestures, allowing you to pause your music (tap), raise the volume (slide your finger in a circle clockwise) turn it down (slide your finger in a circle anti-clockwise), skip to the next song (swipe forwards)... you get what I mean, I hated this at first but it's really grew on me over the past few weeks I've been using these headphones and I don't think I want to go back to physical buttons anymore, just be very careful not to accidentally raise your volume while trying to lower it like I did.So how is the sound?Honestly... It didn't live up to my expectations, sound is very subjective so don't decide whether or not to buy these just from this paragraph, try them yourself if possible.The sound isn't really bad, it's just so average for such an expensive set of headphones, it's definitely better than cheaper options like the 85h in my opinion but not enough to make it worth twice the price, if you're looking for bass you won't get it here, if you're looking for soundstage you won't get it here, if you're looking for realism you won't get it here, the sound is just so hard to describe, it does everything yet also does nothing, don't get me wrong, I like the sound, but it's just so... boring.If you've got the kind of money to buy headphones like these without hesitation, I probably couldn't recommend you a better option that offers everything these do, they really are nice but just fall short in one of the most important parts to me, they are most definitely worth a go and if you like the sound, I am genuinely happy for you, one sound signature can't work for everyone after all.That's about it, thanks for reading my review!

Die Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX sind erstaunlich gut. In einer flachen Transportschale befinden sich die optisch schicken und erstaunlich leichten Kopfhörer. Das geringe Gewicht hat mich erstaunt und positiv überrascht. Der Tragekomfort ist dadurch und durch die angenehm weichen Ohrmuscheln super.Das Verbinden via Bluetooth geht problemlos und die Verbindung ist stabil. Die Akkulaufzeit ist mehr als ausreichend und beim Klang... nun, ich bin hier ein Fachmann und habe kein absolutes Gehör, dass der Sound aber spitze ist, das kann ich sagen. Der Klang ist klar, der Bass super ohne übertrieben zu sein und ich frage mich, wie B&O das bei diesem Gewicht schafft. Auch das ANC funktioniert super, tiefe Töne verschwinden fast vollständig und bei den Höhen reicht schon leise Musik um auch diese auszublenden.Für rund 500 Euro definitiv kein Schnäppchen aber gut angelegtes Geld wenn man hochwertigen Klanggenuss mag und ich bin sicher, man hat an diesen Kopfhörern viele Jahre seine Freude.Fazit: Teuer aber hoher Tragekomfort und toller Klang.

Premetto che si, mi piace molto ascoltare musica, si sono attento al dettaglio e alla qualità dei suoni, ma non sono un audiofilo e  le mie valutazioni di ascolto sono piuttosto soggettive e dipendono molto dai miei gusti in fatto di generi musicali.Prediligo il folk, il pop rock degli anni 70, e come contemporanei amo solo pochi autori come Chris Pureka o Glen Hansard, ho quindi, mi rendo conto, ho vedute un po' ristrette in questo settore.Anni fa ho trovato nelle Sennheiser Momentum 2 una cuffia che mi ha pienamente soddisfatto e fatto amare e riascoltare sotto una nuova luce album che avevo sentito mille volte, ma ascoltandoli di nuovo con le Sennheiser, la sensazione è di averli ascoltati per la prima volta.E allora ho voluto provare queste nuove Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX, confrontandole con il mio metro di paragone le  Sennheiser Momentum 2.*** COME SUONANOEccoci al momento del primo ascolto, collego sia le mie Sennheiser che le Beoplay al mio amplificatore NAS 320 e inserisco i primi CD nel lettore...La prima impressione di ascolto per le Beoplay è .. nitidezza, .. precisione,... dettaglio...e facendo confronti al volo con le mie Sennheiser, il suono che mi aveva tanto ammaliato e colpito fino ad ora, adesso mi sembrava più “sporco”, notavo nelle Sennheiser una presenza quasi continua delle frequenze basse. Primo round quindi di pancia subito per le nuove Beoplay.Ma questa era la solo la mia prima impressione di ascolto... proseguendo poi con i confronti, ascoltando altri brani, passando del tempo a prendere confidenza con le differenze di sonorità,  quello che inizialmente mi aveva stupito come nitidezza e precisione di riproduzione della Beoplay ha cominciato a vacillare,...è emersa invece come qualità delle Sennheiser quel presentare una forse minore precisione e una presenza forse eccessiva dei toni bassi, non come volume, ma proprio come una presenza di fondo che non ti abbandona mai, è come se tra una nota di basso e l'altra non ci fossero spazi vuoti ma quasi un “continuum” di frequenza basse..E quindi dopo qualche tempo di ascolto ho ribaltato inaspettatamente le mie impressioni, l'eccessiva precisione delle Beoplay risultava per me (attenzione che potrebbe essere questa una valutazione soggettiva) più “stancante” alla lunga.La morbidezza delle Sennheiser è vero che “impasta” leggermente ma è una morbidezza nella quale i suoni risultano più un corpo unico (pur mantenendo la scena ampia), il colpo di rullante secco preciso, quasi una frustata delle Beoplay alla lunga mi affatica, la sensazione con le Sennheiser è di indossare un caldo e morbido maglione dello scorso anno, forse un po' sformato ma molto molto comodo e forse preferibile all'abito giacca e cravatta impeccabile delle Beoplay.Qui va forse detto che può influire molto, e anche qui si evidenziano i miei limiti, il tipo di musica che si ascolta.Per ora le mie impressioni sono state dettate dai miei grandi classici, album dei Dire Straits, con il mio brano test “Private Investigation” su tutti, album dei Pink Floyd, Clapton, suonate piano e voce, ballate Country Rock, ecc.E allora è stato necessario, anche se non sono generi che prediligo, ascoltare generi come il jazz o la musica elettronica , per una completezza di valutazione.Ed ecco un nuovo ribaltamento di fronte: effettivamente ascoltando jazz la precisione maggiore delle Beoplay diventa importante, il dettaglio anche eccessivo mi pare sia ora indispensabile,  soprattutto se mi rimetto le Sennheiser e noto come sia forse fuori luogo il suono eccessivamente caldo che producono.Che dire quindi come giudizio finale? Forse che una sentenza non si può scrivere, non la potete avere da me, comunque.Mi pare di aver capito che l'utilizzo di Beoplay o Sennheiser è fortemente dipendente dal tipo di musica e di atmosfera che si cerca o preferisce.Non ha senso ascoltare “If” dei Pink Floyd con le Beoplay come viceversa non lo ha ascoltare tecno, o jazz con le mie  Sennheiser.Siamo comunque di fronte a due grandi prodotti, e la mia continua incertezza nello sceglie l'una o l'altra come migliore non fa che confermare questo aspetto a mio parere.*** FUNZIONALITA'Qui è già un terreno più facile su cui muoversi.Rispetto alle mie Sennheiser le Beoplay sono su un altro pianeta: mentre sulle Sennheiser per il volume c'è una levetta meccanica, e per il salto brano bisogna affidarsi alla nostra abilità di premere il numero di volte giusto un pulsantino (altrimenti ti parte una chiamata telefonica), qui è tutto molto facile e intuitivo.Tutto è localizzato sul padiglione destro:un tap esegue il play/stop del branouno swipe (avanti o indietro parallelamente al terreno) esegue il next /previous del branouno swipe circolare esegue l'aumento o la diminuzione del volumeIl tutto sia che le cuffie siano in modalità wireless che collegate via cavo. Perfezione , naturalezza dei gesti e comodità assoluta.La App delle Beoplay è fatta in maniera molto funzionale.La parte più importante è la sezione di equalizzazione, dove non è presente il classico grafico delle frequenze, ma una specie di joypad visto dall'alto dove alla posizione centrale corrisponde il settaggio neutro, spostandosi verso l'alto e allontanandosi dal centro, si enfatizzano di più le frequenze alte o quella basse.E' possibile avere dei preset e anche ovviamente salvare il proprio personalizzato che viene memorizzato nelle cuffie anche ad App spenta.Non è possibile creare curve personalizzate tagliando o enfatizzando zone delle frequenze. Personalmente non amo molto questa soluzione, ma anche qui è certamente una mia valutazione soggettiva.*** INDOSSABILITA' ED ESTETICALe cuffie sono molto leggere (pesano esattamente 290 gr.) e calzano in modo perfetto senza affaticare anche dopo ore di ascolto.La pelle dei pad è eccezionalmente morbida.L'estetica è molto minimale, i pulsanti comodi e facili da raggiungere anche a cuffie indossate.*** LA CANCELLAZIONE DEL RUMOREQuesta parte non è al momento in cui scrivo ben documentata,comunque nella App sono disponibili le opzioni:1) ANC Adattivo .Dal sito Beoplay leggo: Cancellazione del rumore adattiva utilizza microfoni e altoparlanti per adattarsi automaticamente all'ambiente circostante. Questo è il tipo di ANC più sofisticato, in cui il livello di cancellazione del rumore si adatta digitalmente all'ambiente circostante. 2) Quantitàdi ANC: qui si regola manualmente tirando lo slider a sx si aumenta la quantitàdi taglio del rumore, mentre a dx la si diminuisce.Sul padiglione sx delle cuffie è presente un pulsante (quello lungo e stretto) che se premuto alternativamente fornisce la funzione di:Trasparenza: consente di ascoltare direttamente il mondo circostante senza disattivare la musica o toglierti gli auricolari dalle orecchie.Neutro: una posizione intermedia tra cancellazione del rumore massima e minimaCancellazione massima La cancellazione del rumore è molto efficace, l'ho provata in stanze molto rumorose con sottofondo di ventole e pc in funzione e il taglio è pressochè totale.*** CONSIDERAZIONI FINALILe Beoplay sono certamente un grande prodotto, con un'estetica ed una cura dei materiali e dei dettagli molto elevata.La qualità del suono non può deludere, ma va forse posta un po' di attenzione al genere musicale verso il quale ci si vuole rivolgere.La sezione di equalizzazione nella App va forse ampliata e migliorata per renderla più precisa e controllabile in modo da far rendere al meglio le Beoplay in ogni condizione di ascolto.In dotazione viene fornita anche una comoda e molto ben fatta custodia rigida per il trasporto delle cuffie e dei cavi di collegamento e di ricarica.Infine una valutazione sul prezzo di vendita (499€ al 3/2021) che è a mio parere leggermente eccessivo, ma come spesso avviene in questo settore , si paga anche il marchio e la qualità a questo connessa.Spero di essere stato utile a chi si sta orientando all'acquisto di questo prodotto, che in ogni caso non vi deluderà.

Si pudiera explicar con dos palabras lo que estos auriculares nos ofrecen simplemente sería: COMODIDAD y CALIDADSuelo usar unos Bose 700 y en algunos momentos se pueden hacer incómodos porque ""aprietan"" un poco para que se mantengan fijos debido a su especial estructura, pero estos Beoplay son brutales: No aprietan pero se ajustan perfectamente al contorno de tu cabeza sin apretar en las orejas.Respecto a la calidad de sonido puedo asegurar, después de que hayan pasado más de 100 auriculares por mis oídos, que la calidad de sonido supera a los Bose 700 y a la serie4 de Sony, sin duda, aunque me quedo con la reducción de ruido de los Bose700.En cuanto a autonomía de batería llega al nivel de los Sony sin ninguna duda.Para el que se quiera gastarse o tenga 500 eur ahorrados para unos auriculares... Estos son los suyos

To spend £450 on headphones, you're going to be either an industry professional or audiophile looking for the very best. And with the Apple AirPods Max at just £100 more, Bang & Olufsen have not only high expectations of their customers to contend with, but inevitable comparisons to Apple too.The first thing I noticed upon opening the box is that these are large headphones. They're clearly made to cover your entire ears and surround you with sound. Indeed, the impressive active-noise cancellation - that actively tracks, measures and covers-up background noise - combined with the large ear cups means that when you close your eyes you're truly immersed in the music. You can hear absolutely nothing except what is being played.Adding to this, the headphones are incredibly light and comfortable. Although the headphones have a big, bulky look to them, immediately upon picking them up they feel light and the squidgy ear cups are incredibly comfortable for as long as you wear them. The result is that you forget you're wearing headphones, which only takes the immersion a step further.Style-wise, I think the headphones look sleek. I personally am not a fan of wearing headphones out in town or on a commute. I also think that this would be potentially risky with such expensive headphones, however in a social setting, coffee shop, work environment, or just at home they look good. I went with the black ones, which seem to resist dirt and scratches well too.The sound quality is superb, as you'd hope! Everything sounds authentic - music is punchy and incredibly clear. I tested a load of music and podcasts and movies to make sure all ranges were where'd I like them to be and I couldn't find anything I can complain about. I can honestly say these are the best sounding headphones I have used, even before I began playing with settings in the app. Moving on to the app, I think this app would be one of my slight frustrations with these headphones. There's an amazing array of customisation options and the ability to tailor your listening experience to your exact preferences, but you do have to login to the app and spend time setting up your profile and product, which is a bit time consuming and annoying. I'd much rather the app didn't require me to create an account. It's a small complaint, but one I feel I need to mention.The headphones do have a built in mic that is 'good'. I wouldn't say it is 'studio' quality or anywhere near it, but it's impressive for a mic that's buried in the headphones somewhere. I'm reluctant to reduce scoring for a not-so-outstanding mic, as I think the mic is there for convenience so you can take a phone call if one comes in when you're using them or maybe have a quick zoom chat. It's not being marketed as a mic to record podcasts or vocals and I don't know of any headphones near this price range that offer this.Battery life is phenomenal. With a 3 hour charge you're getting upwards of 35 hours playtime. Even when the battery runs out you can use the headphones either via USB or the included lead with a 3.5mm jack to continue listening to music until you can charge them. These cables have their own storage space in the included fabric case, which itself is just big enough to keep everything in. It looks great and suits the minimalistic style of the headphones well.Look, at £450 these headphones aren't going to be within everyone's budget. However, if you are in the industry or are really into your music and want to spoil yourself then I think these headphones are probably the most comfortable, best sounding headphones you could buy. Not for a moment whilst wearing these could I think of anyway I'd change them. They'll be my go to for quite some time.

These are premium wireless headphones; they are over-ear but relatively compact and lightweight (285g). They are an upgrade of the previous model, Beoplay H9, with longer battery life (35 hours), upgraded ANC (Active Noise Cancellation), and four microphones in place of two. It is not top of the B&O range; for that you need to spend quite a bit more for the H95. Gamers are directed to the similarly-priced Portal model which has a few more features (Dolby Atmos, Xbox Wireless) but shorter battery life and no case; worth considering as it probably sounds equally good but I do not have a Portal to compare.What you are paying for with the HX is a beautiful minimalist design and excellent sound quality. The sound is clean, sweet and exceptionally clear, perfect for extended listening sessions. Trying these out is a matter of “I just want to hear how they sound on [insert another favourite track]”; they convey every detail and are superbly tuneful. It is almost easier to describe what they don’t do: the bass is not distorted or exaggerated, notes are not smeared, they are never harsh. Listening to an old favourite like Kind of Blue by Miles Davis you can follow the bass lines easily, hear every nuance of the percussion. Applause on Alison Krauss and the Union Station live sounds like it does at a concert, many hands clapping. Listening to Richard Thompson’s guitar work on Acoustic Classics you get a sense of the texture of the strings plus amazing realism from the vocals. The drama on the opening bars of Beethoven’s 9th symphony, performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Leonard Bernstein, is wonderfully communicated.In other words, if you are a hi-fi enthusiast, the HX will remind you of why. I could also easily hear the difference between the same tracks on Spotify, and CD or high-res tracks on my Sony player. AptX HD is supported.That said, there are unfortunately a few annoyances; not deal-breakers but they must be mentioned. First, the HX has touch controls for play/pause, volume, and skip track. I dislike touch controls because you get no tactile feedback and it is easy to trigger accidentally. With the HX you play/pause by tapping the right earcup; it’s not pleasant even when it works because you get a thump sound in your ear, and half the time you don’t hit it quite right, or you think you haven’t, tap again, then realise you did and have now tapped twice. Swipe for skip track works better, but volume is not so good, you have to use a circular motion and it is curiously difficult to get a small change; nothing seems to happen, then it jumps up or down. Or you trigger skip track by mistake. Ugh.Luckily there are some real buttons on the HX. These cover on/off, and ANC control, which toggles between on, transparent (hear external sounds) and inactive. There is also a multi-button which activates voice assistants if you use these.Second, there is an app. I tried it on an iPad. Major annoyance here is that it does not work at all unless you create an account with B&O and sign in. Why should you have to sign in to use your headphones? What are the privacy implications? That aside, I had a few issues getting the app to find the HX, but once I succeeded there are a few extra features. In particular, you can set listening modes which are really custom EQ, or create your own EQ using an unusual graphic controller that sets a balance between Bright, Energetic, Warm and Relaxed. You can also update firmware, set wear detection on or off (pauses play when headphones are removed). Finally, and perhaps most important, you can tune the ANC, though changes don’t seem to persist if you then operate the button. You can also enable Adaptive ANC which is meant to adjust the level of ANC automatically according to the surroundings. It didn’t seem to me to make much difference but maybe it does if you are moving about.The ANC is pretty good though. I have a simple test; I work in a room with a constant hum from servers and ANC should cut out this noise. It does. Further, engaging ANC doesn’t change the sound much, other than cutting out noise, which is how it should work.There is a 3.5mm jack connection for wired use, but with two important limitations. First, this does not work at all if the battery is flat; the headphones must be turned on. Second, the jack connection lacks the extra connection that enables use for calling, so for listening only. The sound quality was no better wired, perhaps slightly worse, so of limited value.Despite a few annoyances I really like these headphones. I doubt I will use the app, other than for firmware updates, and rarely bother with the touch controls, which means I can enjoy the lovely sound, elegant design, good noise cancelling, and comfortable wear.

Here is my review of the B & O Beoplay HX ( H10 )Mine is the Black Anthracite variant as the other colours were not available at launch when this review was written.The main selling features of these portable headphones are the adaptive active noise cancellation and the transparency but I will talk about that further below.Accessories - They come with a very nice, well made and sturdy case which also holds the USB A to Type C charge cable and the 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable which are both 1.25m in length. Also has some documentation which consists of basic user guide and safety information.Battery - They last around 40hrs with Bluetooth only and around 35hrs max with the active noise cancelling on take around 2 hours to charge but bear in mind this battery life depends on your listening volume.Build and functionality - The build and design is one of the best I have seen but the type of ear pads they use means it can get warm around the ears which is one of the negatives of this. On the left ear cup there is the ANC/Transparency button but it does not say a prompt of which mode you have selected which should be addressed as it is not always obvious of the selected mode, two microphones and the multi function button and I am not sure if this button can be programmed for other uses. On the right ear cup is the 3.5mm input but can only be used when the headphones is powered on which is a negative but at least it is not a proprietary connection, type c input for charging with a status led if it is charging or full charged and the power/pair button with a status led and two microphones as well. The touch controls are intuitive and you get used to them pretty quickly if you are listening to music or on a call.Comfort - I found these very comfortable but like I wrote above they can get warm around the ears. I have a smaller head so the clamp on these was just enough but if you have larger you will be fine and they have plenty of height adjustment. They are also light weight at 285g so I had no issues with the weight of these. The headphones can also be laid flat like in my pictures so you can rest them around your neck and L and R are clearly labeled so you know which way round they are worn.B & O app - These are compatible with the app and it offers basic functionality like it can do firmware updates, a basic equaliser with presets, control volume and play/pause and control the strength of the active noise cancelling and transparency mode. Two things I don't like are you have to create an account and have to have location services enabled. There is also a function with adjustable strength if you take the headphones off it will automatically pause the track and when you put them back on it will continue the song for example.ANC and transparency - These both work to a very high standard but a negative is that when the button is pressed to change the modes it should prompt which mode you selected so if you are in a quiet room it will be hard to tell which one is in use. The active noise cancelling is adaptive so adjusts itself to the situation you are in.Bluetooth - They use AAC/SBC and Adaptive AptX with Bluetooth 5.1 and is what I used with my phone which is a Poco F2 Pro. Signal strength and connectivity was perfect, supports multipoint so can be connected to your phone and laptop at the same time and supports all the fast pairing certifications for really easy pairing.Sound - I found these to have a pretty neutral sound signature which is meant to be the B&O house sound and makes a change from all the V shaped sound signatures out there. I found everything very clear with no harshness and represented the sound how the music artists want you to. Hard to fault the sound to be honest. Microphone quality was also very clear.Overall these are very good but the price is a bit off putting but the fit, finish and engineering that went into I am not surprised. The ear cups are even detachable if you need to replace them.Cons of these headphones are price, no voice prompt when changing ANC/Transparency modes, 3.5mm only works when they are turned on, your head can get warm where the ear pads touch your head, app is a bit intrusive with log in required and location services required.Overview is these are very good portable on the go headphones if you are okay with the cons I mentioned above.

I’m not an audiophile. My AirPods stopped working so I decided I wanted to try on-ear noise canceling headphones with a long battery life. My primary intention is to use them for work calls.I ordered the Bose QC45, very happy with them (I should also mention I was happy with the sound from my basic AirPods before). Except I couldn’t wear them for longer than an hour because my ears would start profusely sweating??? I googled this and turns out it’s a thing! Some people get hot ears from the synthetic material of the ear cups.The main reason I ordered these was because of the leather ear cups. It worked! No more sweaty ears. My ears are bigger than the round part, maybe that’s why, but I still find them very comfortable. Given the “lack of seal” I find the ANC to be fine for my needs.One thing I find annoying is that to put them back in their case, you have to slide the sides back in. They slide smoothly and aren’t notched. So basically, every time I take them out of the case I have to readjust them when I put them on, and since they’re not notched as you slide the sides out I find myself readjusting a few times.The other thing - I was getting frustrated connecting these to my windows work laptop for video calls, but then I remembered there’s an audio jack in the case so now I just use that with no issues. I don’t think they automatically connect to my iPhone like the Bose ones did, but that may be user error. It doesn’t seem like you can easily go between devices like I can with my AirPods from iPhone to MacBook. I didn’t find the app to be intuitive for this either. Hopefully I’ll eventually figure it out.Lastly, I did find that these needed to be broken in - I didn’t know that was a thing, the Bose ones didn’t. Right out of the box, music sounded like it did with my AirPods. I played with the settings, etc. For my needs I didn’t really care, I just wanted my ears to stop sweating. Then one day I was listening to music and the sound was much more impressive.I ordered the sand color, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten black. The case is light grey for these and I’m concerned about staining over time if I’m not super careful. Subjective, but I think black would probably also look more sophisticated on video calls. Overall I’m very happy with these!

I will say these are a very good set of headphones. Not perfect. But good.I'm just not having the issues I've read in a few bad reviews here. Everything works fine on mine. Volume control, next play swipe both work fine. The noise canceling is satisfactory to me. I know there are some that may be better in that department. But they are good enough.The other high points about these are that they are very light and comfortable and after hours wearing still no issue hurting my ears or feeling heavy. They completely seal around my ears making for a truly great experience.The very long battery life is a major plus too.I've owned good headphones that only last like 4 or 5 hours and that's a deal breaker for me because I wear them all the time.Now I own numerous pairs of headphones and my Master and Dynamics mw65's are quite good too. Especially if you hook them up through an audio cable and it really increases the sound quality like 10 times better than the Bluetooth function on that pair. That's really the only way I use them. They also are a little heavy and don't make a perfect seal around the ears. But I am curious on how the new mw75's, that Master and Dynamics just came out with, sound like and if they've increased the sound quality in Bluetooth mode.Overall after about 10 hours of break in on  these B/O HX's, they sound very well. They do need a break in period.I know that everyone might not agree and are picky beyond belief, but these are worth the money. High quality build and sound. I definitely would buy again.

Very Impressive set! What stood out the most was the build quality and sounds - top notch!! Some quirks, listed below.1. Sound: OMG amazing. The finesse, the quality of sound is the best I have heard. The experience is exquisite, in that you can really pick apart instruments, vocals and mids and the bass. The lows are balanced and refined - this is not going to rattle your head, so bass head stay clear. These headphone really shine for any genre that emphasizes vocals and instruments. Volume does not get crazy, probably a good thing!2. Connectivity: Top notch, power on and instant pair. Multi device use was seamless, pause on one, easily play on the next device. Pulling connection from a third device to a paired one was a also quick.3. Build & Comfort. Excellent build, feels premium and great in the hands. My only issue was the ear cups being round and not accommodating the largish ears. Clamp force was just fine as well.4. Features: ANC vs. Normal - barely any difference. Touch controls for volume took some getting used to. Would have much preferred physical buttons.5. Call quality: sub par compared to other.Returned these with a lot of hesitation, if it physically fit me properly I would have kept and overlooked the quirks.

Sadly returning. I really wanted to like them. I love the brand and own four of their Bluetooth speakers, more importantly for years I enjoyed very much the H9i. Sadly I haven't enjoyed their new line of headphones.  I bought a pair of H95 then returned because they are quite uncomfortable, I believe this is primarily because of their excessive weight but excessive clamping force and shape of the ear pads aren't a plus either.Disappointingly not much to be excited about their sound, moreover costing just about the double of everything else out there, to possibly offset the discomfort in wearing this $900 pair of headphones.Too much disappointment for too much money.I really wanted to continue to wear the beautifully built B&O so I ordered the HX. Now I'm back in H9i territory. Very comfortable headphone built with high quality materials and with a stunning look.However while they sound better than my old  H9i and have a much improved noise cancellation circuit the HX can't compete with the incredibly refined sound of the cheaper and ultralight weight Sennheiser Momentum 4 nor with their even better noise cancellation feature.I really hated the idea to return the stunning looking HX but the sound of the Momentum 4 is so superior  that the far superior aesthetics of the HX was not enough to win me.

For the price you pay, it's annoying instead of comfortable!First, it's impossible to have it for a long time. The headphone is heavy and you want to remove them for a while. Second, ear cups are round instead of oval. As such, it feels weird around your ears.The sound quality is good and volume control is super easy. I had no issues with connections or noise cancelation. Overall, if I could I would return it (I did not use it for three months and I did not have the opportunity to return it anymore)

Pros:- Very high quality materials- Beautiful design- ComfortableCons:- Volume control unusable for me. After several hours of practice I still couldn't control it reliably or oftentimes at all.- Sound quality very disappointing. Not awful, just not nearly as good as I'd hoped.Deal-breakers for me on any headphone or earbud are shouty, sibilant treble and fiddly controls. The HXs suffer from fiddly controls. I could swipe forward and back pretty reliably, but volume control was well nigh impossible for me.The sound quality was warm and smooth, but it really lacked any life at all in the top end. I know I'm fussy; first I don't want shouty treble and then I say I want life and liveliness in the top end. Well, I want what I want. For reference, my AirPods Max have life in the top end, which only ever overpowers me on poorly-mixed tracks. Ditto for sibilant consonants.I gave the HXs a go because I wanted a better wired option than my AirPods Max or my Jabra 85h for listening connected to a DAC. The Jabras have a very good sound, but Apple Music Hi-Res lossless and TIDAL MQA expose a thin-sounding weak spot in the male vocal range that gets annoying after a while. I'm looking for something better. I know the Jabras and the HXs are primarily bluetooth headphones, but I wanted something that could be wired for Hi-Res listening without jumping into the deep end of the pool of audiophile wired headphones.I'm returning these for the (essentially) broken volume control design.

I have tried quite a few headphones and these are the best of the lot for me. The fit, sound, voice quality, battery life and stability are terrific.

I’m not an audiophile. My AirPods stopped working so I decided I wanted to try on-ear noise canceling headphones with a long battery life. My primary intention is to use them for work calls.I ordered the Bose QC45, very happy with them (I should also mention I was happy with the sound from my basic AirPods before). Except I couldn’t wear them for longer than an hour because my ears would start profusely sweating??? I googled this and turns out it’s a thing! Some people get hot ears from the synthetic material of the ear cups.The main reason I ordered these was because of the leather ear cups. It worked! No more sweaty ears. My ears are bigger than the round part, maybe that’s why, but I still find them very comfortable. Given the “lack of seal” I find the ANC to be fine for my needs.One thing I find annoying is that to put them back in their case, you have to slide the sides back in. They slide smoothly and aren’t notched. So basically, every time I take them out of the case I have to readjust them when I put them on, and since they’re not notched as you slide the sides out I find myself readjusting a few times.The other thing - I was getting frustrated connecting these to my windows work laptop for video calls, but then I remembered there’s an audio jack in the case so now I just use that with no issues. I don’t think they automatically connect to my iPhone like the Bose ones did, but that may be user error. It doesn’t seem like you can easily go between devices like I can with my AirPods from iPhone to MacBook. I didn’t find the app to be intuitive for this either. Hopefully I’ll eventually figure it out.Lastly, I did find that these needed to be broken in - I didn’t know that was a thing, the Bose ones didn’t. Right out of the box, music sounded like it did with my AirPods. I played with the settings, etc. For my needs I didn’t really care, I just wanted my ears to stop sweating. Then one day I was listening to music and the sound was much more impressive.I ordered the sand color, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten black. The case is light grey for these and I’m concerned about staining over time if I’m not super careful. Subjective, but I think black would probably also look more sophisticated on video calls. Overall I’m very happy with these!

I did truly love these headphones. I'm a fan of the aesthetics and sound. I've tried many headphones, looking for the ones that play music to my ears. I did return these though due to my ears not fitting completely under the ear pad. No discomfort, even after hours of listening but found it to be troublesome with creating a good seal. Another note, there is circular engraving in the ear cups. There are also earcup commands by swiping on them. The engraving can be quite annoying when trying to skip songs due to your finger naturally wanting to follow the engraving.Still overall great headphones. Can't comment on noise cancelling as it's not really a feature I pay attention to. Isnt the whole point of it to not pay attention? Cant be bad then.

These are absolutely beautiful headphones and the sound is very good.

Swiping in the other direction went back maybe 50% of the time. The volume control sometimes responds and mostly doesn’t.You can control music from the app on your phone but who wants to do that.

Just wanted to mention that I did not buy these from Amazon, I bought them directly from the B&O online store.I'm going to be truthful because I'm a big fan of B&O. The Beoplay HXs sound, feel, and look very amazing. I don't know really where to start the review.Sound quality: Your typical B&O sound quality. Beautiful, clean, crisp, doesn't sacrifice any instrument, thumping bass but it's not obnoxious or distorts other instruments and/or vocals. Music separation is fantastic. Not like open back or closed-back headphones that are meant to be plugged into an AMP/DAC but it's damn near close. My favorite out-of-the-box sound signature/sound quality brand of headphones where I don't have to tweak the EQ (that much) is B&O, Sennheiser, Monolith, Master & Dynamic, Audeze, and Grado.Battery: B&O claims a 35-hour battery with ANC n and a few more hours with it off. That's incredible and it's true so far. I'm very impressed with the battery.Connection: You can connect through BT or with a wire. Now, this is the one downside to these headphones. When you use the cable, you HAVE to turn the headphones on to hear audio. If I'm wrong, someone please correct me. I'm not going to deduct a star because it doesn't play a huge part to me.- The 5.1 BT connection is solid and doesn't break the connection when my phone is in my pocket or when I'm 2 floors down and left my phone on the third floor.Noise Cancelation: I've owned a pair of H9 3rd Gens and ever since owning those, I've always thought why B&O isn't taken seriously when comparing ANC to say Sony or Bose, the kings.- Let's say ANC is a 10/10 on both Sony and Bose, the HXs are a 9.5/10. Same with the 3rd Gens from what I remember.I'll say it again, I love the HXs. B&O delivers another worthy, beautiful product. What else is new?

I wouldn’t exactly consider myself an audiophile when I see how hard core some real audiophiles are. I’m not super knowledgeable on the technical side and don’t have a seemingly bottomless budget to spend on owning a wide variety of equipment. However, I do care very much about enjoying my music at the highest level of detail possible.You know the feeling you get when you invest hours into research looking for the optimal product, the product finally arrives in a package at your house, and it really is as great as you were hoping for? That’s the feeling I had the first time I tried on my new Beoplay HX’s. My goal was to find the best sounding headphones to wear out in public, whether it’s for traveling or doing work at a coffee shop or library. And I have finally found the best product for myself. I have owned multiple pairs of headphones from the Bose QC line and the Sony XM line that I used to use for this purpose. But then I spoiled myself by listening to my Sennheiser HD 660S at home too much, and Bose and Sony no longer sounded good enough for me to enjoy my music.Sound quality:Like I was saying, my primary draw to these was that I was looking for the best sound quality possible for a pair of headphones of this class. Technically, the H95 would probably be better if I like these, but they were not on my list of considerations because I was not willing to pay the $850 price tag. In terms of level of enjoyment of music, the HX’s beat all similar noise cancelling headphones I have tried, including all Bose and Sony and other Beoplay headphones. Tight and clear bass which I like, good mids, and enough treble without the fatigue. I have always had a strong dislike for fatiguing treble, because it’s tricky to get the right balance of hearing the treble well but being able to tolerate long listening sessions without the fatigue. These do an excellent job of getting the right balance.Noise cancelling:These are not best in class for noise cancelling, but they fit my standard of “good enough”. And honestly, they’re really not significantly worse than best in class. I did a side by side comparison with my Sony XM3 while playing simulated engine and coffee shop noise from a third device. And while the XM3’s did do better, I could only tell the difference with music off. With music playing, the two pairs felt similar. My standard of “good enough” means that when I’m in a noisy environment, I can enjoy my music with most of the details without needing to blast the volume. At most, I would want the volume to be one notch higher than I would keep it at home in a quiet environment. These definitely get the job done for these intents and purposes.I have also owned the H9 3rd generation and tried the Beoplay Portal, and the HX’s, at least to my ears, beat both by a decent margin. Compared to the H9 3rd, these are better in that the bass is tighter and more refined, and there’s more sparkle or clarity in the mids and treble. I read from multiple sources that the Portals were supposed to have the same drivers as the HX’s, but they don’t sound the same at all. I purchased a pair of Portals to replace my H9’s and was sorely disappointed when I tried them on. My logic was that if HX’s and Portals were really that similar, I might as well have the gaming headset option even if I don’t game that often, but they are definitely not the same in sound. I felt like the Portals were more detailed than the H9 3rd generations, but music just wasn’t enjoyable for reasons I can’t completely articulate because my technical knowledge is limited. It may have to do with the way they were tuned, in that they were designed with less of a focus on being musical and more about hearing your game environment.Comfort:In regards to comfort, the things I look for are that whey I lie down, they don’t slip off my head, ears don’t touch inside of earcup, and that I can wear them for a long period of time without uncomfortable pressure or heat in my ears. These definitely fit the criteria I listed. One of my complaints about the Sony XM series was that they would slip down the back of my head when I wanted to lie down with them due to the weight distribution. The Bose QC series were good about not having that problem. The H9 3rd gen that I owned slipped occasionally. I haven’t had much of a problem with these. Also no problem with my ears touching the inside of the earcups, which was another gripe I had with the Sony XM series.Style/design:If I’m going to be wearing my headphones in public, style or design does matter. And in my opinion, these were designed with looks in mind. In my opinion, better looking than the Sony XM series by far, still better looking than the Bose QC series, and the only competitor comparable in style is probably the Bose 700 (which don’t sound good at all). It is worth noting that these don’t collapse, so they do take up more room in my backpack compared to most competitors. But that’s a relatively small tradeoff I’m willing to make if I love the overall package.

Agree with the previous review. My main gripe is the lack of seal on the bottom of each ear cups which compromise noise cancelling and let's quite a bit if ambient sound in.The cups are also surprisingly hard on the ear cartilage since it rest on them too much.Sound is incredible!

I've owned lots of headphones, Bose and otherwise.I use them for hours a day, everyday.They get dropped, jerked around, subjected to all kinds of stress.None has stood up like these B&O headphones.I've had these for almost two years now and not a single issue.The BOSE noise-cancelling headphones I has previously broke after a year.These may seem expensive, but you are getting what you pay for.The only possible alternative may be the Bowers & Wilkins.But, whatever you do, never choose the Sony headphones.Despite being Japanese, the build quality just isn't there.

I bought the HX directly from B&O, not from Amazon, hoping it would mitigate the risk of the touch control issue experienced by many according to Amazon's comment section. It didn't help. I can't tap, swipe, or spin it.Upgrading the software puts the headphones in limbo: I can't turn it off and I can't connect either. Had to factory reset.The power button (and the mode switch button) is much more easily triggered than on H9i, which is bad is my opinion.The sound, comfort, and noise cancelling are actually better than H9i if you trust me, but the robustness is beyond disappointing.

I’ve been a Bang & Olufsen loyalist for years. I own a number of their audio products. The issue I’m having is with their new H9 replacement, Beoplay HX. The touch control is non-responsive to volume control. I’ve owned every generation of the H9 line, RMA’d an H9 3rd Gen previous to the HX, with a defective Bluetooth module.I bought the Beoplay HX days after its release. The unit arrived 5 days from the date of purchase. I was rather disappointed it arrived defective, especially after a previous RMA on an H9 3rd Gen. barely 2 months ago. Also, the noise cancellation doesn't even match the H9, there's leakage into the headphones from the surroundings, or the technology has been degraded in this model. At this rate, quality control is rather concerning compared to previous models. I want to purchase the E8 3rd Gen Sport for the gym but I have decided to hold off, or maybe go with something like Sennheiser or Bose.To put my hardware engineering hat on, in my opinion, the circular swipe design lends itself to problems because of the large capacitive touch area. They call it intuitive but it just doesn’t work as reasonably expected. It’s not flawless like Bose’s even on a good unit. This is my biggest knock on most modern B&O headphones with this volume control mechanism. I’m not sure why B&O insists on these awkward mechanics. I believe Bose is fairly successful in this area because their capacitive swipe is quite smooth and fairly accurate (I’ve owned all models of Bose headphones as well). On the Bose NC 700, to increase the volume, hold and swipe up. To decrease the volume, hold and swipe down. This in my opinion is more intuitive.The HX was the first purchase from the B&O website, I’ve made other purchases on Amazon and their boutique stores around the world. Obtaining an RMA on the online purchase was not an issue, it was a fairly easy process. I take issue with the non-sensical return process. After shelling $500 for a pair of headphones that arrived defective to no fault of mine, I don’t want to wait for another 40 to 50 days to get my hands on another pair. The 30 days free return on the website is misleading at best. It’s really lacking in details to account for this long return process. You don’t get a refund for another 2 to 3 weeks after they receive the defective unit. No matter if it’s the 30 days free return advertised on their website or return for replacement, the return shipping label from the company, in either case, is UPS ground, which could take up to a week to reach their warehouse. Adding to the 2 to 3 weeks RMA return process I mentioned, when all said and done, expect the return and refund process to take a month before you see your money. If you plan to re-purchase another unit, adds another 4 days to 5 days to received the unit. Expect 5 weeks to enjoy your Beoplay HX if you receive a defective unit. I can successfully RMA a Bose product and have my money back in less than a week. The big question becomes, why wait this long if returns are free as advertised? Logic dictates one should get a refund when they receive the unit and verify contents, a process that shouldn’t take more than 48 hours to be charitable. In my opinion, they should add the language “Allow 4 to 6 weeks for free return or RMA,” to be accurate.Alternatively, you can fork more cash to purchase another unit with the hope you will get a refund on the defective unit; that’s a $1,000 opportunity cost to you and cash-at-hand for B&O. If this sounds like a Ponzi scheme, that is my concern. And the story doesn’t end there. The surprise came when I tried to air my concerns to a supervisor or manager. They don’t exist… Similar to the Chinese model of customer service, the support staff you speak to on the phone is the end of the line. They don’t even have anyone to call you back. Per the support team call line, supervisors or managers don’t exist. If support can’t address your issue, you’re SOL!… If I’m purchasing a premium pair of headphones, I expect commensurate customer service. Companies selling $50 headphones have supervisors who can address concerns beyond the support staff level. This is the reason I referred to this manner of doing business as akin to a Ponzi Scheme—everything about the B&O decision-making chain is opaque. This business model appears to be ""TRUST US"", like the majority of Chinese manufacturers. Trust comes with transparency. If you don’t have a front-facing supervisory staff and want to sell consumers, then this is a major problem. Most consumers like to know concerns are being addressed by management should the need arise to escalate an issue. B&O generally makes good products but my online experience has been an eye-opener. In my opinion, they need to be more responsive to customers' concerns, especially if one is to spend a premium on their headphones. I’m not sure they appreciate there is a healthy level of competition with many reputable electronic makers coming on board to get a piece of this rapidly growing pie.From my experience, Bose is a level above the rest when it comes to their RMA process. Even though the return is ground, your exchange is ready to go as soon as UPS scans the return. You can receive an exchange for a defective unit in as little as 3 days from the time you request an RMA. Depending on how fast you need your headphones, shipping on the replacement unit can be upgraded as a courtesy to UPS 2nd Day Air. Compare that with 5 to 6 weeks for B&O. Plus, you can escalate your concerns to the level you wish, they are available to address your concerns. If they make a mistake with their order process, you get a free upgrade or sometimes free headphones. Bose has the best customer service experience in my book when it comes to consumer headphones. That’s what I expect from a premium headphone maker.UPDATE: 4-22-21 - Thoughts After Purchasing the 2nd Headset in Lieu of Waiting For RMA Process to Complete:I went with my option B and bought another pair of headphones while waiting for the previous set to get RMA'd for a full refund hopefully. The problem I stated, with my first headsets--non-responsive volume control swipe--still persists. In my opinion, this is most likely a hardware flaw or a bad production batch. You can't have two different headsets bought at different time periods exhibiting the exact same problem. I'm comparing it to the smooth mechanics of the Beoplay H9 series. I found however that if you press on the control area with a moderate-to-high amount of pressure, it works somewhat, but is far from accurate, or even an ideal solution. This is something Bang & Olufsen engineers may have to address. I'm not sure if this can be done through a firmware update. If it's adjusting sensitivity, this can be done... I like the headphones, the earcups are slighting larger, the sound signature is what you expect from B&O, and the carrying case is finally commensurate with premium headphones. But I'm disappointed with the ANC. It is not as good as the H9, which was not as effective as say Bose NC 700. I will keep them for the 30-day grace period and see if I can live with this big inconvenience if no proposed hardware remedies. If anything changes, I will be sure to provide an update.UPDATE: 4-24-21: Battery LifeWOW!!!... The battery life on these headphones is truly amazing, I just had to share this update.I decided to put together my Summer tracks. I couldn't believe the battery life on these headphones. They last over 48 hours of continuous heavy music listening, with ANC on, at about 80% volume, and still had 20% battery remaining!! I haven't experienced any premium headphones out there with such juice.  You have to move into custom $1,000 plus headphones. Battery life is truly phenomenal, better than advertised in this experience!! Bose NC 700 are ready to quit after less than 24 hours of continuous listening with ANC on. Sony MX1000's go a little longer but nothing compared to the B&O HXs. This is a big positive if you travel frequently.

I bought these knowing I could return them as I was wary of the price.  I have a lot of headphones Sony XM3s, Sennheishre HD600s, Bose QC30s, Senn MTW, etc.  I have to say these are excellent.  Comfort is exemplary - you truly do forget you have them on.  Sound is superb.  Better than Sony's significantly.  Sony's can sound muddy.  Connectivity is finicky at first and almost a deal breaker.  I updated them and also used them for a few days and somehow it sorted itself out.  They always repair with my phone and laptop with a rare issue.  Controls are ok - take some getting used to but work (mostly).  NC is just ok.  I didn't buy these for NC, but can say for sure not as good as Sony's or Bose - but that is expected.  Overall, build quality, sound quality and comfort make these a good purchase imo.

If you like the B&O sound you'll love these. I slightly boosted the bass in the EQ to get the sound I wanted, but they're super crisp and clear. The noise cancelling is decent, better than I was expecting from reviews, but I don't think they'd be great for air travel.My biggest issue is that the Timber marketing photos are completely inaccurate - the leather is bright, almost orange, and not very natural looking. It makes them look cheap. I think I'll be exchanging for a different color.

I’ve been wanting to try Bang & Olufsen headphones for sometime but the H95’s were just too much $$$ for me to justify the expense. However the newer HX’s were a $100 off their regular price so I decided now was the time to try them. I have tried numerous wireless noise canceling headphones over the last year and really liked a number of them but none were exactly right for one reason or another. I tried Sennheiser Momentum 3’s, Bowers & Wilkins PX7’s, Master and Dynamics MW65’s, Shure Aionic 50’s and still own the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and the AirPods Max. In my opinion the Bang & Olufsen HX’s are the best of the lot, overall, but aren’t perfect by any means but are very close. Longer battery life, excellent sound especially when tweaked with the equalizer in the Bang & Olufsen app and are super comfortable for extended wear. Noise cancelling is very good, not Sony level but close. To my ears sound better than the AirPods Max and so much lighter and more comfortable. One note on comfort is yes, the round ear cups are smaller then the rectanglular shape of the AirPods Max and will probably sit a little on your ears as they do mine, however the leather covered memory foam ear pads combined with the light but stable clamping force of these headphones make it a non issue. After 3+ hours of wear I was only minimally aware of them, they are that comfortable. They have a wear detection feature but I found even on the reduced setting it would pause music with the slightest turn of my head so I turned it off. I read longer hair (I do need a hair cut) can cause issues and a recalibration can fix it but it’s not that important to me at this time. As for the only other issue that will bother some is the touch controls are finicky for sure, the play, pause and swipe to change tracks works fine but the volume swipe around the cup is very difficult to get to work, at least for me it has been, but still not that big of a deal to me. I love the sand color with the gold accented aluminum finish on the cups which is eye-catching for sure. Only had them for less than 24 hours so can’t really speak about battery life as of yet but seems to be on par with what Bang & Olufsen claim. Sound quality is top-notch with a well balanced sound the you can adjust in the app to what you like. Bass is precise and pleasant, especially on the warmer side of the eq but not overpowering like some. It hits the sweet spot for me. Over-all these are my favorite headphones yet and I highly recommend them especially at the Black Friday prices! I may update later as I use them more and after I use them outside of the apartment. I’m a headphone addict I guess and I love these headphones!11/28/21 Update. The wear sensors work great as long as you calibrate them first: have the headphones on a flat surface, turn them on, turn in the wear sensors and then put them on. Once calibrated they work perfectly. I do recommend the “reduced sensitivity “ setting. Also the volume slider works fine as long as you are swiping in the right spot inside the ring on the right ear cup. Battery life is as advertised! Love them!Update 12/16/21: Sadly, I decided to return these headphones for a couple of reasons: noise cancelling was not very strong and didn’t really block out much noise (especially on the bus commuting to work). The wear sensors worked when calibrated every time you turn on the headphones but when I had them connected to both my iPhone and iPad Pro they would always auto play music from my iPad no matter what I had been listening to prior to turning them on/off. Also the sound was very finicky, they sounded great for instrumental and jazz but other genres weren’t as great with either sharp highs or the bass would distort at higher volumes (even after the software update was supposed to fix this issue). I was constantly having to adjust the EQ to find a good sound that wouldn’t sound great across all songs. I really wanted to love them because of the premium design, materials and good looks, but in the end decided they weren’t worth the high price. Went back to the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and am happy with my decision (strong sound and excellent noise cancellation).Update Again, 2/16/22. After purchasing and liking Shure’s Aonic 40 headphones, but not satisfied with their build quality, I couldn’t resist purchasing the B & O Beoplay HX (this time in Black Anthracite) again and I’m so happy I did. (What was I thinking returning them?) the build quality is first rate, super comfortable (despite the round ear cups which do sit on my ears a bit, but are soft and really comfortable even for long periods) and the sound quality is the best over all that I’ve tested. I wasn’t impressed the first time with the noise cancellation but upon this second listen realize it is better than I gave it credit for and slightly better than than the noise cancellation on the Shure’s. Once you find the right spot on the unusual eq in the app the sound is kind of unparalleled. The only issues I have found is the wear sensors don’t always work so I turned them off, and the multi-point connection causes some unwanted functions like automatically playing from my iPad Pro even if I was listening on my iPhone last time they were connected. (Auto play not an issue with the sensors turned off anyway). Also, the touch controls are finicky but I’ve found most are.  Not deal breakers for me. I revised my rating and now highly recommend the HX, particularly at a discounted price (they are pricey, but you get what you pay for, as they say!)

 ATTENZIONE!!! ATTENZIONE!!! ATTENZIONE!!!  AGGIORNAMENTO RISOLUTIVO Ver. 2.0.1Oggi 30.10.2021, come faccio periodicamente con i prodotti che recensisco in modo particolarmente negativo, tendo a rianalizzarli per verificare eventuali interventi risolutivi da parte delle Aziende produttrici.  Oggi è toccato alla cuffia Bang&Olufsen HX, e a conferma del fatto che ciò che ho cercato di dimostrare nel video che trovate in allegato e descritto in recensione corrispondeva a verità, mi sono ritrovato un aggiornamento in Applicazione da parte dell'azienda B&O  dove è riportato il difetto di distorsione di cui parlavo. Circa un ora fa ho proceduto all'aggiornamento firmware  Ver.2.0.1 e ho riverificato con la mia solita scrupolosità la cuffia. Posso affermare con estrema soddisfazione e facendo i complimenti alla Bang&Olufsen che il problema è stato risolto completamente. Adesso si che riesco ad apprezzarla pienamente e confermare il fatto che si tratta di una cuffia premium di elevatissima qualità generale.ATTENZIONE !!  TUTTO QUELLO CHE LEGGERETE DA QUI IN POI E' LA RECENSIONE CHE PUBBLICAI IL GIORNO 09.04.2021. ANCHE IL VIDEO DIMOSTRATIVO RACCONTA IL DIFETTO CHE ADESSO NON E' PIU' PRESENTE, ADESSO SUONA IN MODO MERAVIGLIOSO!RECENSIONE CUFFIA BLUETOOTH BANG & OLUFSEN BEOPLAY HX- PICCOLA PREMESSANutro la passione per l'ascolto della musica fin da quando ero bambino. Ho posseduto e provato nel corso della mia vita le più svariate tipologie di cuffie, cablate, wireless, da gaming, IN-EAR, OVER Ear e chi più ne ha più ne metta.Possiedo e ascolto cuffie del calibro di Marshall, Yamaha, Sennheiser Sony, Jabra, e le vario a seconda della tipologia di genere musicale che in quel momento mi va di ascoltare.Dico fin da subito che al momento la cuffia bluetooth OVER-EAR che preferisco in assoluto è la Sony WH-1000XM4 che utilizzo con estrema soddisfazione quasi tutti i giorni. Sarà quindi inevitabile qualche confronto diretto con le BEOPLAY HX.INIZIO A RACCONTARE QUELLA CHE E' STATA LA MIA DELUDENTE ESPERIENZANon ho mai avuto fino a questo momento la possibilità di provare una cuffia del prestigioso brand B&O e avendo avuto questa occasione, ero particolarmente euforico, per cui anche le aspettative erano estremamente elevate.Non appena mi è arrivata ho installato l'applicazione della B&O sul mio Iphone X per l'accoppiamento. Fatto ciò, l'applicazione mi ha indicato la presenza di un firmware più aggiornato e prima di iniziare ad utilizzare la cuffia l'ho aggiornata alla versione 1.2.9.L'ho indossata ed ho iniziato ad ascoltare per una mezzoretta generi pop, jazz e leggera mantenendo il volume della cuffia a non più del 50%. La pulizia, la chiarezza, la precisione dai bassi e la brillantezza degli alti mi ha immediatamente rapito! Un suono davvero fantastico, un livello di dettaglio e fedeltà a dir poco disarmante. Davvero meravigliose è stata la prima cosa che ho pensato.Dopo la prima oretta di ascolto ""SOFT"" ho iniziato a spingermi oltre il 50% di volume per valutare il livello di massima pressione sonora. Che dire, fantastico anche questo....mah,,,, iniziavo a percepire qualcosa che non mi convinceva.Quando ero i al 100% del volume, apprezzavo su alcuni brani un qualcosa che non riuscivo a focalizzare bene, tipo uno scoppiettio, un gracchio, una distorsione... un qualcosa che saltuariamente veniva fuori su delle variazioni soprattutto dei bassi e sugli alti all'interno dei brani.Non ho dato tanta importanza a questa ""cosa poco chiara"" e ho proseguito con lo studio della cuffia e della sua applicazione. Ho apprezzato all'interno dell'applicazione la presenza di un equalizzatore con Preset e personalizzabile ed ho iniziato a colorare maggiormente le basse e le alte frequenze. Improvvisamente ho iniziato ad avvertire quel ""rumore poco chiaro"" di cui vi parlavo prima,  in modo decisamente più forte, fastidioso e incomprensibile. Sembravano delle scariche improvvise sui driver estremamente fastidiose e preoccupanti. Non vi nascondo che ho iniziato a pensare ad una inspiegabile rottura della cuffia. Quindi ho iniziato a fare tantissime prove. L'ho collegata in streaming AAC su Iphone, successivamente l'ho collegata in Aptx su uno smartphone Android per poi passare al collegamento cablato attraverso il jack da 3,5 mm e il DIFETTO ENORME ERA SEMPRE PRESENTE.Dopo tante prove ero giunto alla conclusione che con molta probabilità avevo ricevuto uno sfortunato campione guasto. Considerata l'importanza ed il peso negativo che avrebbe avuto la mia recensione su questo prodotto, ho voluto approfondire la questione acquistando da Amazon la stessa cuffia per fare una comparativa con quella ricevuta tramite programma Vine. Senza allungarmi troppo, sono rimasto di stucco quando ho constatato lo stesso e identico difetto anche sulla seconda cuffia.HO INIZIATO A PENSARE CHE STESSI SBAGLIANDO IO QUALCOSA, anche perchè leggevo sul web altri recensori che non lamentavano lo stesso problema. Fortunatamente mi sono accorto che l'aveva appena recensita POSITIVAMENTE uno youtuber italiano che stimo tantissimo. Ovviamente gli ho scritto subito nei commenti chiedendo se lui aveva notato lo stesso problema. La prima volta mi ha risposto di no, ma quando gli ho scritto di provare la cuffia al massimo volume e spostandosi manualmente con l'equalizzatore mi ha confermato che riscontrava lo stesso problema.Nonostante avessi avuto la prima conferma dallo Youtuber, non mi sono fermato qui. Infatti ho contattato un rivenditore B&O presente nella mia zona spiegando il problema che stavo riscontrando. Il rivenditore si è reso subito disponibile e non credeva a quello che gli stavo raccontando. Mi ha detto che aveva appena ricevuto un campione di questa cuffia in negozio e che potevamo analizzare la cosa. Così è stato, Il gentilissimo signore ha installato e aggiornato la sua Beoplay HX sul suo smartphone Android  ed ha constatato SBALORDITO l'effettiva problematica di cui vi ho parlato. Ovviamente per spiegare al meglio a chi sta leggendo questa recensione il problema, ho fatto un video in cui vi mostro il difetto sulla mia B&O HX. Tenete presente però che siamo a 4 cuffie su 4 con lo stesso problema, fate un pò voi..PARLIAMO UN PO' DEGLI ALTRI ASPETTI DI QUESTA CUFFIAIL DESIGN l'ho trovato davvero fantastico, un attenzione ai dettagli minimale. Materiali come alluminio e vera pelle rendono questa cuffia estremamente elegante e raffinata a livello estetico.ANCHE RISPETTO ALLA COMODITA' c'è poco di cui potersi lamentare, l'ho trovata estremamente comoda, stringe il giusto, non pesa molto (285g) ed è piuttosto compatta e non invadente sul capo.L'AUTONOMIA è OTTIMA considerando che può suonare per circa 40 ore senza ANC e circa 35 ore con ANC attiva.L'APPLICAZIONE se paragonata a quella disponibile per la cuffia Sony MX4 è decisamente più ""ESSENZIALE"". Si può solo controllare l'equalizzazione ( abbiamo ascoltato in che modo!! ). Si può controllare il livello di cancellazione del rumore e impostare altre due cosette come il tempo di standby prima dell'autospegnimento e attivare/disattivare la funzione di autoplay e pausa quando togliamo la cuffia da capo, nulla in più.LA CANCELLAZIONE ATTIVA DEL RUMORE, unita a quella passiva è da apprezzare. A parer mio funziona molto bene e riesce ad abbattere di molto i rumori esterni. Anche in questo comparto la cuffia di Sony fa un pelino meglio ma in questo comparto la B&O mi ha convinto positivamente.MANCA UNA GUIDA VOCALE e abituato alla Sony MX4 dove è presente, avverto molto la mancanza nell'utilizzo della cancellazione del rumore ad esempio. Quando sulla B&O attivo tramite il pulsante la cancellazione del rumore o la disattivo, avverto solo dei toni difficili da interpretare. Se poi stiamo ascoltando della musica questi toni non si avvertono assolutamente, anche perchè vengono riprodotti lasciando la musica al massimo volume. Sulla cuffia di Sony, quando si attiva L'ANC la guida vocale lo segnala riducendo momentaneamente la musica per poi farla riprendere morbidamente.ALTRA COSA SCOMODA RISPETTO alla MX4 di Sony è che se mi si avvicina una persona che mi sta parlando mentre ascolto musica, sono costretto o a togliere la cuffia dalla testa per poterci parlare. In alternativa dovrei mettere in pausa la musica con un tap sul padiglione DX e premere il pulsante sul padiglione SX per disattivare l'ANC e impostare la modalita' trasparenza. Sulla MX4 di Sony, mentre ascolto musica posso poggiare la mano sul padiglione e la cuffia attiverà immediatamente la modalità trasparenza riducendo la musica. Tolta la mano la musica risalirà in modo soft e si riattiverà L'ANC ( se attivato in precedenza).UN'ALTRA COSA PER CUI PREFERISCO la mx4 di Sony è in fatto che la cuffia è pieghevole, per cui una volta chiusa occupa pochissimo spazio riducendo abbondantemente la dimensione della custodia necessaria per il trasporto.LE MIE PERSONALI CONSIDERAZIONI IN CONCLUSIONEPer me non è mai un piacere trovarmi a dover penalizzare un prodotto con il mio giudizio. Capisco bene e mi rendo conto che dietro ad ogni prodotto c'è gente che lavora e si impegna. Purtroppo in questo caso non posso fare diversamente. Una cuffia che è arrivata da me con aspettative altissime e che ha saputo darmi parecchia delusione.Tengo a sottolineare che se utilizzate la cuffia al 60% del volume, anche enfatizzando gli alti o i bassi con l'equalizzatore, il problema non si presenta e la cuffia offre un suono davvero eccezionale.I problemi (a parer mio davvero molto gravi) vengono fuori quando si inizia ad andare oltre il 60/70% del volume. Siete disposti a spendere circa 500,00 Euro al 07.04.2021 per una cuffia con questi limiti e caratteristiche generali? A voi la scelta.Sono abbastanza sicuro che la maggior parte dei lettori, leggendo la mia recensione penserà che ho sbagliato io qualcosa e che non possibile che la Beoplay HX soffra della problematica descritta. Sono altrettanto convito però, che se deciderete di acquistarla, dopo un minuto di utilizzo ripenserete alla mia recensione.Sperando di esservi stato di aiuto con la mia esperienza a riguardo di questa Bang&Olufsen Beoplay HX, ne approfitto per salutare.

Me encantan estos auriculares:en cuanto a su construcción, elección y selección materiales empleados, así como su mecanizado y ajuste, tengo que decir que estoy muuuy satisfecho, ni la más mínima holgura, marca, rebaba, ruido , nada de cada, calidad de materiales y calidad de construcción por totas partes, destila calidad y exclusividad, un 10 sin duda alguna.son muy cómodos, se sientes claramente más que los Bose que acabo de jubilar, pero sin embargo se sujetan algo mejor y no fatigan tanto con el paso de las horas.respecto al sonido , los uso casi por completo para ver cine, Netflix , series...etc , por lo que no me interesan auriculares con ""color del sonido""  sino que quiero un sonido neutro y fiel al original ,  sin procesado o tendencia a resaltar una frecuencias sobre las otras como es el caso de Sony ( probé el harchirecomendado SONY WH100XM4 que es un fantástico auricular pero más orientado a música e incluso más hacia unos géneros musicales concretos) , el sonido del estos B&O es especialmente nítido y preciso, se distinguen con precisión los distintos sonidos tanto en canal como frecuencias y la experiencia envolvente es bastante convincente, mis viejos Bose aunque muy buenos en este sentido se quedan 2 pasos por detrás justificando en mi caso la inversión que supone el cambio de auriculares.solo los uso en casa por lo que las funciones de cancelación de sonido no las uso salvo el modo transparente que no conocía y me está resultando útil.como crítica constructiva diría que el sistema táctil de control de volumen o pausa/ playa no es tan ágil como otras opciones, la casi ausencia de botones mejora la estética ligera y elegante eso sí.la caja de trasporte es de calidad y robusta, nada que ver con los trapos o bolsas con velcro de otros auriculares que también tienen un precio elevado.el emparejamiento es muy rápidolos amantes de los graves bien presentes deberían de optar por otros fabricantes, los graves en estos B&O estar están ... pero no más que medios o agudos.estos B&O  cuestan un dinero.. pero ademas de costarlo tambien lo valen, el valor se ve, se toca y se escucha, se ajusta perfectamente a mis necesidades de uso sin duda.como escribi al empezar... me encantan estos  auriculares.

Reçu ce jour et essayé de suite.Ce qui frappe immédiatement c’est la qualité de finition et les matériaux utilisés, là on peut dire qu’on en a pour son argent!Le son est cristallin mais on peut le retoucher grâce à l’equalizer de l’application (qui est très bien faite) si vous sentez le besoin d’avoir quelque chose de différent.Ce son est assez extraordinaire, au niveau des Shure ou B&W que je connais bien, cela va ceci dit un peu dans tous les sens avec les sons saturés (mais je recherche la petite bête)Très bon achat

Bueno, después ya de uno días con ellos y probando diferentes usos voy a dar mi opinión.La fabricación es excelente, el diseño es cuestión de gustos, pero para mi son de los más bonitos, también son muy cómodos, te traen una funda de viaje rígida que está bastante bien, pensaba comprar una ya que yo estos los usos para cuando voy de viaje, así que eso me ahorro.👍Detalles tecnicos, la conexión con mi teléfono ( iPhone) rápida y fácil, la app de B&O está bien, me parece completa. Los controles táctiles no son de los de mejor respuesta, los botones físicos si van bien, la cancelación de ruido no es la mejor que yo he probado ni de lejos, en mi caso predomina la firma de sonido a esta función pero si para ti es muy importante creo tienes mejores opciones.Pasemos a lo más importante, el Sonido; definido, “suave”, frecuencias altas claras, sin ser demasiado brillantes pero bien detalladas, medios, excelentes lo tiene casi todo, detallados,las texturas perfectamente definidas, amplias, las frecuencias bajas, he visto opiniones que dicen les falta bajos, en mi opinión no, creo son correctos además los puedes ecualizar desde su propia app asi que no, están bien, es verdad que no son para Bass Heads, pero es que no lo pretenden, son para todo tipo de musica, yo personalmente escucho de todo, así que como la app permite ecualizar y guardar diferentes tipos yo los tengo guardados y los uso para cada tipo de música género.En fin, que creo son muy buena compra, si además les hacéis seguimiento y los podéis conseguir con alguna promoción como hice yo creo os satisfarán bastante. Saludos!

Nichts ist so schwer, wie die Beurteilung eines kopfhörer's. Wenn es nach mir geht.Denn es gibt kaum eine Kategorie, wo die Meinungen weiter auseinander gehen wie beim Thema Klang. Was genau definiert einen guten Klang? Das kann man so einfach nicht beurteilen, da die Geschmäcker und Vorlieben da sehr sehr weit auseinander gehen. Ein Bild von einem Fernseher kann man gut und einfach beurteilen. Aber nicht den Klang.Meine Reise, bei der ich auf der Suche nach einem Kopfhörer bin geht nun ca. 3 Jahre. Wie viele andere auch, habe ich die ersten Kopfhörer anhand von Rezensionen gekauft, ausprobiert, zurück geschickt oder wieder verkauft. Schließlich habe ich mich eine Zeit lang für ein Modell entschieden, aber eher aus Frust als das ich wirklich Zufrieden damit war.Meine Anforderungen waren folgende, der Wichtigkeit nach sortiert:- Kräftiger, trotzdem dezenter Bass, besonders tief und auch wahrnehmbar bei leisen Lautstärken. Ich will nicht dazu gezwungen werden bei einem Lied, welches mir aufgrund des Bass gefällt, den Lautsprecher lauter zu machen, damit ich etwas vom Bass mitbekomme.- Dann gibt es noch den Bass, der so present ist (was zwar Geil ist), wo man aber nach einer Stunde Kopfschmerzen bekommt, weil es in Bereichen doch zu viel ist und die Ausgewogenheit fehlt. Am besten kann ich es bei Szenen beschreiben, wo ich den Kopfhörer nutze um Filme zu schauen. Da gibt es kurze Szenen bei dem ordentlich was los ist, und dann gibt es auch Szenen, wo die Packung an Action doch etwas länger geht und der Kopfhörer dann unangenehm wird, weil der Bass zu intensiv ist. Das sind dann die Momente, wo man freiwillig etwas leiser macht, und nach der Actionszene dann wieder lauter. Vielleicht versteht ihr was ich meine.- Der Kopfhörer muss Musik und Filme wiedergeben können. Hier scheitert es bei den meisten Kopfhörern- Der übrige Klang sollte so klar und detailreich wie möglich sein. Ich liebe Höhen, wenn sie klar sind und hasse Mitteltöne wenn sie zu betont sind.- Und zu guter letzt, sollte der Kopfhörer angenehm zu tragen sein. Auf dem Schädel, Ohren, und längere Sitzungen aushalten ohne Schweißgebatete Ohren zu bekommen.- ANC und Transparenz Modi kommen ganz zum schluss!Auf meiner Reise habe ich nun folgende Modelle durch:- Bose QC 35. Trifft meinen Geschmack überhaupt nicht. Lässt sich nicht nach meinen belieben anpassen- Sony WH 3000, tolle Höhen und mitten, gut abgestimmt. Aber der Bass kommt viel zu kurz.- Sennheiser RS 175, Super zum Filme schauen, aber bei Musik stößt er zu oft an seine Grenzen- Sennheiser Momentum, kommt dem Bang Olufsen HX schon sehr nahe. Unterschiede gibt es nur in Nuancen.Das sind die Kopfhörer, die es geschafft haben, wenigstens eine längere Test phase bei mir zu bleiben. Alle anderen Spare ich mir aufzuzählen, da sie direkt nach den ersten 10 Minuten wieder in den Karton gewandert sind.Und nun bekommt ihr meine Erfahrung, mit den Bang Olufsen HX!Karton und Verpackung, alles schön. Interessiert keine Sau! Die Kopfhörer selbst, perfekt verarbeitet, so wie es sich in dieser Preiskategorie gehört! Das erste Einrichten erfordert die Installation einer App, danach kann es los gehen mit koppeln usw. und sofort!Jetzt muss ich sagen, das ich die Kopfhörer nach der ersten Inbetriebnahme und nach den ersten 10 Minuten, beinahe wieder in den Karton gelegt hätte. Denn die Voreingestellten Klangmodis sind allesamt einfach nur schrecklich. Wie bereits erwähnt, ich hasse es wenn Mitteltöne zu betont sind. Und genau das ist hier er Fall gewesen.Dann habe ich aber Glücklicherweise den Button ""Custom"" entdeckt, wo man einen Punkt in einem Kreis hin und herschieben kann und sich die Tonlage entsprechend verändert. Mehr Bass, mehr Wärme, mehr Höhen usw. Man kann hier ziemlich gut den eigenen Geschmack auskunden ohne dabei ein Profi sein zu müssen.Nach einer halben Stunde habe ich mir dann 2 eigene Profile angelegt, die es in die weitere Test phase geschafft haben. Und nun, nach einer Woche Intensiver Nutzung ist die Entscheidung gefallen. DAS SIND DIE BESTEN KOPFHÖRER, DIE ICH JE HATTE!!!Die Klangqualität ist herausragend. Der Bass ist present, ohne aufdringlich zu werden. Höhen sind klar und extrem detailreich, ohne Schrill zu werden. Man hört Details heraus, die man vorher noch nie wahrgenommen hat. Egal ob ich Leise oder etwas lauter höre, egal ob Film oder Musik. Ein Segen in jeder hinsicht.In den letzten Tagen habe ich die Kopfhörer teilweise 10 Stunden am Stück auf gehabt, was dank des Transparenz Modus kein Problem war.Ich konnte mich in Ruhe mit meiner Frau unterhalten und dabei im Hintergrund Musik hören. Als es mir dann zu viel wurde, habe ich den ANC Modus aktiviert und ich war Glücklich. Einfach immer mit dem Kopf nicken, dann ist alles gut. Die Kopfhörer sitzen schließlich sehr Sicher. Zumindest auf meiner Birne. Ich finde, jeder Mann braucht einen ANC Kopfhörer.Spaß beiseite, was ich damit sagen will. Sie sind unfassbar bequem. Als hätte Bang Olufsen meinen Schädel als Muster genommen und den Kopfhörer drumherum gebaut. Ich setze den Kopfhörer manchmal Vormittags auf, höre Musik und lasse den Tag mit 1-2 Filmen bis in die Nacht ausklingen. Kein Problem, keine verschwitzen Ohren, keine Druckstellen. Man vergisst schnell, daß man sie trägt. Besser kann ich es mir nicht vorstellen.Es mag sein, daß das ANC bei anderen Kopfhörern besser funktioniert. Das ist für mich persönlich nicht schlimm, da es der wenigste Grund für diese Kopfhörer ist.Die Laufzeit ist unglaublich gut. Ein mal in der Woche laden bei sehr intensiver Nutzung reicht voll aus.Habe ich auch noch was zu bemängeln?Jein. Ich hätte mir gewünscht, daß die Ohrmuscheln einen tacken größer oder Oval währen. Mein Ohr passt gerade so hinein. Für mich ist das noch ok, aber ich glaube es gibt Menschen, die noch etwas größere Ohren haben. Für die wird es komisch.Ich kann euch nur empfehlen, besorgt euch den Bang Olufsen, gibt ihm eine Chance, legt euch ein oder mehrere eigene Profile an. Testet ihn und probiert danach meinet wegen den Kopfhörer aus, den ihr vorher hattet.Denn ich selbst habe nun das Problem, das ich seid dem Bang Olufsen HX meine IN Ears nicht mehr mag, weil sie schlechter klingen =) Die fand ich vorher übrigens richtig gut.Von mir, vollste Empfehlung !!!

→La qualité de fabrication est au rdv.→ ANC ne fonctionne pas et le SON en Mode neutre est digne des écouteurs à 10€ (lol). c'est une honte.→ l'application vous permet de corriger le SON mais Si non, la musique sera très très métalliques et sera en manque de spacialisation.Également un manque de définition.Une fois les réglages sur EQ de l' application réalisé, une toucher plus à rien.• VERDICT :UNE ARNAQUE SI VOUS L' AVEZ ACHAT AU PRIX FORT.• NOTE :Les Bang and Olufsen model : EQ, sont bien meilleur sur la qualité sonore et ANC mais pas sur les commandes tactiles.• Passer votre chemin Pour autre chose car à 500€, c'est Chère payé pour une expérience sonore bas de gamme.Bizarre 😒Cordialement.

Mes casques précédents sont sans réduction active du bruit, mais avec une qualité sonore au top... je vais donc essayer de faire un commentaire utile pour ceux qui achètent pour la première fois un casque avec ANC, car je ne peux pas comparer l'efficacité du Beoplay HX avec d'autres solutions existantes.Donc je commence par une précision importante, malgré les commentaires parfois élogieux ou dithyrambique sur l'ANC, évitons de vendre du rêve, cela réduit le bruit environnant mais il n'y a pas de miracle. Pour les porteurs de lunettes, cela peut même être carrément décevant (présence de fuite de son au niveau des branches). De plus, l'ANC produit une sorte de pression acoustique pouvant occasionner une sensation désagréable, une sorte de tension permanente... bref n'oublions pas qu'un bon casque passif avec des écouteurs bien isolés peut répondre parfaitement au besoin (et bien mieux qu'une ANC avec une piètre isolation du casque !!!)... donc n'achetez de casque ANC que pour un usage où il est réellement utile (transports en commun). Pour le reste, pensez au passif (et la batterie vous remerciera).Ensuite, sur les qualités du Beoplay HX, je souligne la bonne facture et surtout les matériaux utilisés (cuir véritable pour les coussinets ! très peu de casques en proposent). C'est ce qui me fait aimer (et garder) ce casque. Le son est de bonne qualité mais rien de sensationnel, un peu neutre, je ne vois pas beaucoup d'intérêt à la sorte d'equalizer fourni avec l'application.D'ailleurs la gestion du son me laisse un avis mitigé, pas assez graduelle (on bascule vite dans le trop fort, et les marches d'augmentation du son sont trop marquées, j'aurais préféré quelque chose de plus progressif).Une véritable fausse note sur le pilotage tactile du casque, une vraie catastrophe (voir les autres commentaires... ce n'est pas exagéré, le casque est franchement raté de ce point de vue, à croire que personne ne l'a testé avant la commercialisation !)Alors je mets 4 étoiles parce que j'y ai quand même mis le prix (et ça me fait mal au coeur de contredire un choix que j'ai fait en lisant ici et là les différents tests...) mais honnêtement je pense que cela ne vaut pas plus que la moitié de son prix...

 Nachdem ich nach einigem Testen um die Weihnachtszeit zu meinen phänomenalen Beyerdynamic DT 1770 gekommen bin, dachte ich das diese auch auf Reisen und abseits der Heimat die richtige Wahl sind. Aber Kabel und auch die Transportgrösse, haben mich leidereines anderen belehrt.Also doch Blauzahn mit ANC und klapp- oder faltbar mit geringem Packmass und exzellenter Klangqualität. Dazu noch ausdauernd und von fühlbar guter Qualität.Das kann schwierig werden…Die Beyerdynamic Lagoon fielen schon zur Weihnachtszeit raus - kein Bassfundament, ANC mit starken Nebengeräuschen…Die Sennheiser Momentum waren da schon eine andere Qualität. Luftig und mit kräftigem Bass. Aber Soundstage und vor allem das Soundimaging ließen neben meinen DT 1770 doch deutlich zu wünschen übrig.Beats ist Bassgewummer (sorry)Und Sony habe zwar tolles ANC aber der Rest ist nicht mein Geschmack.Nun sind diese Höreindrücke immer subjektiv. Ich höre gerne auch analytisch. Ich liebe es bei Jazzaufnahmen die Instrumente einzeln herausgearbeitet auf der Bühne zu erleben. Ein elektrischer Bass muss schnell, knackig und trocken kommen und vom warmen und weichen akustischen Bass unterscheidbar sein.Stimmen sollen mich berühren - nicht anschreien oder gar zischeln.Diana Krall ist ein Beispiel für hervorragende Aufnahmequalität, die eine Kette entweder zum Kofferradio degradiert oder aber einen Jazzclub als Bühne ausbaut, in der diese Stimme den Raum bekommt den sie verdient.Und dann sah ich das Osterangebot der Bang Olufsen HX. Also kommen lassen, was gewohnt schnell ging.Schon beim unboxing war die Liebe zum Detail deutlich, was sich bei der ersten haptischen Annäherung bestätigte. Leder und gebürstetes Metall zeigen das Design eben auch mit Qualität einher gehen. (Wenn man es denn kann)Dann auf die Ohren. Ich war anfänglich etwas in Sorge da die Ohrmuscheln irgendwie zu klein aussehen, aber der Tragekomfort ist schlicht toll. Trotz der Materialauswahl ist der KH leicht und auch nach Stunden immer noch nicht unangenehm oder störendDer Memoryfoam sorgt für ein gutes Anliegen am Kopf und der Anpressdruck ist nicht störend. Gleichwohl sitzen sie sicher.Die versprochenen 30-35 Std. Ausdauer der Akkus erscheinen glaubhaft. Jedenfalls ist nach den langen, österlichen Sessions (auch mit Filmen!) am Ende der Musik übrig noch viel Akku übrig - und nicht umgekehrt!Ach, die Akkus lassen sich tauschen - ohne die KH entsorgen zu müssen. Das ist nach meiner Kenntnis der einzige Hersteller der Nachhaltigkeit groß schreibt.Doch nun zum eigentlich entscheidenden.Als erstes möchte ich das ANC abarbeiten. Mir reicht es völlig aus wenn ich im Garten NUR Musik höre und das Gezwitscher der Vögel völlig ausgesperrt ist. Wie sich das im Zug anhört oder im Flieger muss ich noch testen.Was man dann musikalisch auf die Ohren bekommt ist schon großes Kino. Egal ob Jazz, Klassic oder guter R&B - immer ist es eine wohlige Mischung aus fein und deutlich erkennbaren Instrumenten und großartigen Stimmen die die Bühne bereiten für Hörgenuss. Das alles unaufdringlich ohne sich in den Vordergrund zu spielen. Bässe kommen tiiief und knackig an, ohne auch nur ein Anzeichen von billigem Effektgehasche im Form ungebührlichen Brummens oder gar Wummern zu zeigen.Die intuitiv bedienbare App erlaubt es den Sound dem eigenen Hörempfinden oder der Musikrichtung anzupassen. Genial einfach gemacht.Die Bang Olufsen HX kommen nicht ganz an die Spielfreude und Dynamic meiner DT1770 heran, besonders wenn diese mit einem Röhrenverstärker befeuert werden.Aber das war auch nicht die AufgabeEs sind schlicht die Besten kabellosen KH die ich bis jetzt gehört habe.Ich vermisse nichts und habe meine Traumkopfhörer für den mobilen Einsatz gefunden.Die gebe ich nicht mehr weg.Update 26.08.2022Ich habe nun die KH ausgiebig auf Flugreisen (Japan) und Zugreisen testen können.Das ANC reicht mir aus. Im Flieger habe ich zuerst gedacht - die Turbinen sollte ich doch eigentlich nicht hören und lüftete die Kopfhörer um dann dankbar zu sein das ANC eine sehr großen Teile des Lärms aussperrt. So kann man immer koch Musik genießen.Auch im Zug funktioniert das sehr gut, grade bei diesem recht gleichmäßigen Geräusch.Und 12 Std Flug, zu einen großen Teil mit KH für Musik oder Filme bringen die Akkulaufzeit nicht an die Grenzen. Auch der Rückflug (14 Std.) ging ohne nachladen!!Respekt.Also alles richtig gemacht mit diesen Kopfhörern!!

Ho sempre voluto delle cuffie high end e con queste posso dire che ho realizzato il sogno.Le beoplay Hx hanno una fedeltà del suono eccezionale,  riesci sentire ogni strumento presente con alti e medi molto chiari,  l'unica nota dove magari molti non piacerà sono i bassi che non sparano in modo eccessivo,  però i bassi presenti sono molto puliti e abbastanza forti da farsi notare .Durata della batteria e molto buona,  riesci tirate tanti giorni senza ricarica .La pressione sulle orecchie non è alta direi abbastanza forte da non dare fastidio anche dopo 4 ore d'uso.Custodia un po ingombrante ma a me non da fastidio.Decisamente soddisfatto.

Ich bin auf der Suche nach einem Nachfolger für meinen Bose QC15.Verglichen habe ich damit diese Modelle:- Bowers & Wilkins P5- Bowers & Wilkins PX7- Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HXBevor die Daumen nach unten zeigen - ich weiß sehr wohl, dass der Vergleich nicht ebenbürtig ist, dass der QC15 und P5 kabelgebundene Modelle sind. Zudem handelt es sich beim P5 um ein On-Ear-Model ohne ANC...Den PX7 und den HX halte ich jedoch für auf ganzes Line vergleichbar und genau auf diese beiden aktuellen Modelle zielt meine Bewertung ab.Der PX7 hat mich sehr interessiert, da mir die Klarheit und die gute Soundauflösung des P5 sehr gut gefallen hatte. Was dem P5 an Bass fehlt hat der PX7 nun schon fast zu viel. Dabei ist es nicht wirklich die Intensität des Bass, die mich stört sondern vielmehr das der Bass ""matschig"" klingt und die verschiedenen Frequenzen (Tiefbass / Kickbass) bei den meisten Titeln verwaschen. In diesem Punkt (Bass) ist der PX7 meiner Meinung genauso gut (oder schlecht) wie der Bose QC15.Die Mitten und Höhen sind gut (viel schöner als beim QC15) aber auch hier ist Luft nach oben.Die Mitten und Höhen des B&O HX sind meiner Meinung nach Spitzenklasse. Ebenso die Soundauflösung und Ortbarkeit der Instrumente sowie auch die Stimmwiedergabe sind glasklar und sauber. Die Basswiedergabe lässt beim HX meiner Meinung nach zu wünschen übrig. Bei Lautstärken >50% ist der Bass okay. Die Bässe kommen in den verschiedenen Frequenzen klar und sauber rüber - könnten aber für meinen Geschmack etwas intensiver sein. Das Nachjustieren über die App ist einfach, führt jedoch dazu, dass auch beim HX die Bassfrequenzen verwaschen und die sauber Trennung von Tiefbass und Kickbass verloren geht.Bei leisen Lautstärken <25% zeigt sich die größte Schwäche des HX. Hier bleiben die Höhen und Mitte zwar weiterhin klar, jedoch geht das Klangvolumen völlig verloren. Bässe kommen nur noch zum Vorschein, wenn über die App massiv nachgeregelt wird.Außerdem fällt bei sehr leiser Lautstärke (oder bei pausierter Musik) ein sehr leichtes Rauschen auf, was auch durch die verschiedenen ANC-Anpassungen nicht verschwindet (nur unterschiedlich klingt).Die ANC-Funktion des PX7 ist sehr gut (vergleichbar mit dem QC15). Der HX hat hier eine deutlich geringer Geräuschunterdrückung, was mir jedoch im Hausgebrauch ausreichen würde.Der Tragekomfort ist bei allen von mir verglichen Over-Ear-Modellen sehr gut. Tendenziell würde ich dem B&O HX die beste Haptik und Komfort bescheinigen aber das ist sicher weitgehend von den anatomischen Gegebenheiten eines jeden Hörers abhängig.Alles in Allem hat mich der B&W PX7 aufgrund der ""verwaschenen"" Basswiedergabe und Unterlegenheit im Klangbild im Vergleich zum HX nicht überzeugt. Insgesamt ist es jedoch ein durchaus guter Kopfhörer, der seinen Preis (225€ bei Amazon) wert ist.Der B&O HX wäre fast mein neuer Kopfhörer geworden, wenn er nur ein wenig mehr Druck bei den Bässen, v.a. etwas mehr Volumen bei geringen Lautstärken zu bieten hätte.Meiner Einschätzung nach ist das seine einzige Schwäche und wer häufig mit mittlerer oder höherer Lautstärke (z.B. unterwegs) hört, ist mit dem HX sehr gut beraten. Für meinen Zweck, in ruhiger Couch-Umgebung auf entspannt Musik zu genießen, fehlt der letzte Schliff.

Lieferung erfolgte wie von Amazon und dem Verkäufer angegeben.Die Kopfhörer waren Originalverpackt, hätte auch nicht anderes erwartet wenn ich ein neues Produkt bestelle.Die Kopfhörer sind von der Verarbeitung als auch vom Klangbild hervorragend. Nicht zu basslastig oder zu höhenlastig. Der Klang wird in den Normaleinstellungen perfekt neutral wiedergegeben und über das App kann man sich je nach Geschmack und Musikrichtung den Sound so einstellen das er passt.Die Kopfhörer umschließen meine Ohren komplett, wo ich mir im Vorfeld nicht sicher war ob sie das tun.Das mitgelieferte Case inkl. Ladekabel und 3,5mm Kopfhörer Stecker sind ebenfalls top, wie man sich das von B&O erwartet.Wie gesagt, Top Produkt und der Preis hierfür ist auf jeden Fall angemessen.Wie gesagt, Top Kopfhörer!!!!

Mes impressions à chaud avec ce nouveau casque de B&O qui fait suite aux Beoplay 9i ..les +Qualité de construction: rien à dire c'est premium et classieux, et semble solide,Confort : très bon, léger, n'appuie pas trop sur les oreilles, pas excessif sur le haut du crâne,Connection : impeccable sur Apple iOS, rien à dire,Application : bien dans l'ensemble mais pas beaucoup de recul,Micro appels téléphoniques : la bonne surprise ! testé en environnement calme et à un carrefour passant : les bruits extérieurs sont bien neutralisés, la voix est un peu distante mais claire et compréhensible. J'ai testé beaucoup de casques sur cette fonctionnalité et B&O s'en tire très bien,Le son : très bon, je n'ai pas testé l'égaliseur dans l'appli mais c'est déjà du son premium, bien équilibré avec de bonnes basses, mediums très corrects, il me semble juste un poil trop prononcé dans les aigus. A la hauteur de l'ambition du casque mais pas sûr que ce soit le meilleur,L'étui de protection et transport : très bon, solide, protège bien et assez classe,Garantie 3 ans (après enregistrement du produit sur le site) : bravo B&O !les -La réduction de bruit : pas encore au niveau des meilleurs en réduction maximum et pas assez de recul pour un ressenti sur la réduction de bruit adapté, à voir plus tard, important car ce pourrait être une de ses grandes forces,L'ergonomie : pas habitué peut être mais les commandes sensitives sur l'oreille droite me semblent imprécises. Je dois taper/faire glisser mon doigt parfois plusieurs fois pour exécuter la commande, un peu frustrant voire désagréable (petits chocs sur l'oreille),L'ergonomie suite : régler le son en faisant glisser le doigt de manière circulaire ne fonctionne pas bien, ou alors je n'ai pas encore la pratique; ça manque de réactivité et précision, dommage, i'idée est bonne.Et donc quel rapport qualité/prix ?  c'est un casque cher et premium, cela se voit quand vous l'avez en main et l'écoutez, dommage que tout ne soit pas impeccable quant à sa manipulation (des défauts de jeunesse ?) mais c'est peut être moi qui n'ai pas encore pris l'habitude.Enfin peut être que des mises à jour de son firmware amélioreront  l'annulation de bruit, pas encore au niveau des meilleurs je pense.En espérant que cela vous soit utile.

Vorab: Ich besitze ebenfalls die Beoplay H7, und der HX ist mein erster Kopfhörer mit ANC.Positiv:Wie auch beim Vorgänger, ist sie Verarbeitung, das Material und Tragegefühl wirklich ausgezeichnet. Ich würde sogar sagen, dass der HX ein wenig gemütlicher als der H7, auf Grund der weicheren Bügelinnenseite, ist.Generell ist der Klang warm und ausgewogen. Die Höhen und Mitten sind sehr klar, man kann einzelne Instrumente wirklich gut heraushören und Orten. Es ist keiner Meinung nach nicht nötig am Equalizer in der App rumzuspielen, der Default Klang ist sehr sehr schön. An der Lautstärke ist ebenfalls nichts auszusetzen, auf 100% ist er mir zu laut, um die 70% +/- scheint mein sweet Spot, je nach Aufnahme/Song, zu liegen.Ohne Bewertung:Da ich vorher kein ANC besaß, kann ich darüber nicht viel sagen, der Effekt scheint jedoch verhältnismäßig dezent zu sein. Dunklere Töne werden deutlich besser herausgefiltert als Hochfrequente. Ich empfinde es als angenehm, wenn nichts läuft, beim Musik hören selbst, ist es mir nicht besonders aufgefallen, habe es aber auch noch nicht unter extremen Bedingungen getestet.Den Transparenz-Modus jedoch braucht man meiner Meinung nach einfach nicht. Höre mit Musik meine Umgebung immer noch nicht und ohne, kann ich die Hörer ja auch einfach absetzen.Jetzt leider etwas negatives:Die Farbe, die die Fotos suggerieren (Inkl. dem auf dem Karton), weicht bei dem ""dunklem"" Modell, von der Realität ab. Es ist ein sichtbar hellerer Grauton. Leider konnte auch ich dies nicht gut auf einem Foto einfangen. Allerdings besitze ich auch keine Fotobox o.Ä. und nur eine Smartphone Kamera.Das Touchpad ist bei weitem nicht so gut, wie beim H7. Die Funktion um Songs zu überspringen oder zurück zu spulen funktioniert nur, wenn man wirklich von Kante zu Kante des Metallteils wischt und auch dann nur sehr unzuverlässig. Gefühlte 1 von 5 malen, oft wird dann stattdessen das Lied pausiert oder es passiert einfach nichts. Selbst die einfache Pause-Funktion, mit einer einzelnen Berührung führt nicht immer zum gewünschten Ergebnis. Von der Laut/Leise-Funktion wage ich kaum zu sprechen. Sie funktionierte bei mir bisher schlichtweg gar nicht. (Allerdings gab es dort auch bei meinem H7 kleinere Probelme).Kurzgesagt: Touchpad, nicht gut.Fazit:Wem es rein um Klang und Tragekomfort geht wird hier vermutlich nichts missen. Wenn allerdings andere technische Spielereien (ANC, Touch-Control) sehr wichtig sind, sollte sich das ganze vorher mal genauer anschauen.Für meine Bedürfnisse finde ich es jedoch ein sehr gelungenes Produkt. Allerdings kann man bei dem Preis auch mehr Perfektion in den genannten ""Problembereichen"" erwarten.

I bought these in a sale and got them for around £300 instead of the usual price. After using them for a while I would definitely say the sale price is “getting your moneys worth” but at the normal price, I’d understand if someone said they were disappointed.I work as a mechanic in a workshop environment, it’s always noisy and the headphones get bashed about a bit. I’ve owned them for two months now and have hit them, scraped them and dropped them against all sorts of car components and I’m very impressed by the complete lack of damage.The noise cancellation is okay, I wouldn’t say it’s absolutely amazing. Anything noisier than a hand dryer and you can hear it as if you’re not wearing the headphones, but for commuting or general use, it’s fine.I am overall impressed and would recommend them, the battery life is pretty impressive but the app is a bit clunky and a bit of a let down.

These are a downgrade over previous models I have. Not as well built and the sound is definitely not to my liking (the H9i and 3rd gen have a much richer and broader sound). I find myself listening to my older models. The extra battery life is a positive but you can't replace the battery so that's also a negative. I wouldn't recommend these unless they're heavily discounted in a sale.

Got these for a great price but they did not live up to my expectations. To make it clear they sound superb and are top draw build quality; but they are flawed on many levels. The main problem is the size and shape of the ear cups. If you have larger ears they will sit on your ears and will become uncomfortable very quickly. Secondly they were very inconsistent locating my Wi-Fi. Sent them back with some reluctance.

Le cuffie sono realizzate in maniera impeccabile. Hanno un suono meraviglioso. Ma hanno delle gravissime pecche che mi fanno portare a restituirle, considerando il costo di acquisto molto alto. Io le ho pagate 399 ma il loro prezzo è 499!!!! I controlli touch sono pessimi. Non possono essere utilizzate con cavo senza accenderle, quindi con batteria scarica non le puoi usare. Delusione--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATTENZIONE AGGIORNAMENTO DEL 06/02/2022Innanzitutto voglio ringraziare Amazon. Queste cuffie le ho rese 2 volte. Alla 3° volta che le ho ordinate sono perfette. Il suono è meraviglioso, sono realizzate in maniera impeccabile ed ora al terzo tentativo finalmente i controlli touch funzionano. Sono stato tenace, ma la mia tenacia senza il servizio resi di amazon , non sarebbe stata premiata. Ditemi quale negozio ti dà la possibilità di rendere per ben 2 volte lo stesso prodotto??? Esiste è Amazon!!! Se non le avessi rese 2 volte (non è un gioco) non avrei ottenuto un prodotto meraviglioso come questo!!! Mi suonava male che un marchio prestigioso come Bang&Olufsen mettesse in commercio un prodotto così scadente. Non mi sono arreso fiducioso del marchio. Ma tutto questo è soltanto grazie ad Amazon!!! Mi scuso per averle rese ben 2 volte, ma alla fine avevo ragione io. Sono soltanto incappato in 2 articoli diciamo difettosi. Grazie ancora AMAZON 👏👏👏👏👏Riguardo al prodotto in oggetto, rimangono alcune lacune ""trascurabili"" visto il meraviglioso suono.1) non si possono ascoltare con il cavo da spente, bisogna comunque accenderle. 2) non hanno una guida vocale, ed in particolare questa carenza si sente quando si attiva l'ANC, alla pressione del tasto si sente un suono che si fà fatica a capire a cosa è associato, sarebbe stato utile un messaggio vocale: ANC ON - ANC LOW - ANC MEDIUM - ANC HIGHT- ANC AUTO- ANC OFF....per il resto prodotto da 5 stelle.

Bon alors comment ne pas y aller par 4 chemins..... ce casque est une purge au niveau des commandes, ça marche quand ça veut et on se retrouve très souvent a utiliser les commandes logiciel et donc vu le prix ça pique un peut ! Même beaucoup, seulement voila, le son est limpide, équilibré et le confort au rdv. Très franchement j'aurais renvoyé ce casque si la qualité globale n'était pas au niveau du prix car le reste c'est un zéro pointé.La réduction de bruit fait très correctement le travail et permet de réduire le niveau sonore tout en gardant une bonne dynamique.L'équaliseur de l'application est très bien fait.La mise a jour du firmware a été plutôt épique, déco, reco , déco , reco ... et sans savoir pourquoi ça fini par se faire.. Je suis sur un Oneplus 8 Pro donc pas de soucis niveau compatibilité bluetooth mais la je n'ai pas tout compris.Bref, moi qui cherchait un super casque pour une qualité d'écoute, je suis servi , pour les commandes, la copie est a revoir !

These are excellent wireless headphones and are very easy to use. The build quality is a step above the Sony's etc and for my use the noise cancelling is great. The beoplay app is very simple and provides just the right amount of control for some tinkering. The sound profile out of the box is pretty much spot on for most music types. These are as good as you can get for consumer wireless headphones at this price point.

Im Grunde gibt es nichts, was zu diesem Kopfhörer nicht schon gesagt worden wäre. Die Tonqualität, der Klang – erstklassig. Das ANC System arbeitet ganz hervorragend. Die Materialien sind erstklassig; keine Frage. Das einzige, woran sich hier die Geister scheiden, ist der Innendurchmesser der Ohrpolster. Menschen mit kleinen bis mittelgroßen Ohren haben hier überhaupt keine Probleme. Aber Leute mit größerem Kopf, sprich; großen Ohren werden hier keine Freude haben. Denn entweder werden die Polster das Rohr am unteren oder am oberen Ende ein klemmen. Das mag für 20 Minuten Musikhören noch tragbar sein, aber wenn man den Kopfhörer für lange Zeit tragen möchte – Flugreisen, Bahnreisen etc. – dann macht das keinen Spaß. Vielleicht sollte sogar ein Hersteller wie Bang und Olufsen etwas weniger aufs Design schauen, als auf das, was die Kunden tatsächlich brauchen.

Ich habe eine ganze Weile gezögert, so relativ teure Kopfhörer zu kaufen, aber ich muss sagen, das hat sich absolut gelohnt. Klang, Komfort und Materialverarbeitung dieser Headphones ist absolut top.Vergleichen kann ich es leider nur mit den Bose QC35II, der Sound ist aber in einer ganz anderen Klasse als diese. Detailreich, klar, saubere Höhen und Bässe. Gerade die Bässe, druckvoll und präsent, ohne einem nach 30 Minuten die Ohren vollzubrummen. A Propos Ohren, Tragekomfort ist gut. Auch wenn die Muscheln kleiner sind als die vom Bose, meine Ohren passen rein und die Hörer liegen satt und mit sanftem Druck um die Ohren herum auf.Das ANC ist nach meinem Empfinden super, mindestens dem Bose ebenbürtig. Das muss sich aber noch bei einem Interkontinentalflug bestätigen.Die App ist allerdings zwingend nötig, um den Klang optimal einzustellen. Die Default-Einstellung war mir zu neutral, habe dann im Equalizer die ""Energetic"" Einstellung gewählt. Auch die ANC-Einstellungen sollte man für seinen eigenen Geschmack optimieren.Bei so viel Licht gibt es aber auch etwas Schatten: - die Gestensteuerung ist für mich immer noch ein Glücksspiel. Das einzige was zuverlässig funktioniert ist Start/Stopp. Lautstärkeeinstellung per Kreisbewegung klappt nach einigen Drehungen irgendwann, aber nicht zuverlässig. Und Vorwärts/zurück klappt überhaupt nicht. Oh well... - ab und zu gibt es Bluetooth-Hänger, besonders wenn man zwischen Geräten wechselt. Es hilft dann immer aus/anschalten. - die farbliche Ausführung ist katastrophal. Ich hatte mir eigentlich die Ausführung in ""Timber"" bestellt. Leider kommen die nicht in braunem Leder, sondern eher in einem orangen Ton. B&O Support konnte mir hier nicht helfen, also bin ich auf ""Anthrazit"" umgestiegen. Die sind auch nicht schwarz, sondern eher ein dunkles grau, aber besser als orange...Fazit: diese Kopfhörer sind definitiv ihr Geld wert.

But the noise cancelling occasionally didn’t kick in and the responses from the on ear controls was a little erratic at times. Sound quality is good but not quite to the standard I was hoping for...no better really than my 4 years old and cheaper AKGs. Returned them.

Qualità audio e costruttiva eccezionali. Ottima durata della batteria (ci si dimentica di ricaricarle), buona la cancellazione del rumore...Le uniche pecche che mi sento di segnalare sono i controlli touch per il volume che non sono molto immediati e il rilevamento di quando ti togli le cuffie per metterle in pausa che non sempre funziona...

Tout d'abord, un magnifique appareil : belle ""gueule"", beaux matériaux, magnifique pochette de transport. C'est important d'avoir le sourire en déballant le produit.Ensuite un confort de roi. On ne sent pas l'appareil sur la tête, on peut le garder plusieurs heures sans fatiguer.Enfin le son. Ce n'est certes pas la qualité de mon filaire, nous sommes sur du bluetooth. Mais c'est tellement supérieur aux autres casques bluetooth que j'ai essayé ! La liberté que nous apporte cet appareil est à ce (petit) prix.Je n'ai pu tester la réduction de bruit, j'ai la chance de vivre au milieu des oiseaux.Il y a probablement mieux sur chacun des points ci-dessus, mais l'ensemble est parfait pour moi.Alors, merci B&O et merci Amazon pour la promotion qui rend le coût nettement plus raisonnable.

Ich habe mir diese Kopfhörer gekauft, nachdem ich jahrelang begeistert meine BeoPlay H9i nutzen durfte, meine ersten ANC Kopfhörer. Diese hatten die beste Geräuschunterdrückung, die man sich wünschen konnte und erstklassigen Sound und Bedienung.Leider ist der An-Aus-Schieberegler ins Jenseits gegangen und ich konnte bisher keinen Ersatz aus Fernost finden, den ich stattdessen hätte einlöten können.Also mussten neue ANC Kopfhörer her, natürlich wieder aus dem Hause B&O.Und dann war die Enttäuschung groß.Das ANC der BeoPlay HX ist hier in drei Stufen unterteilt:""Transparenz"" (man hört die Umgebung quasi, als trüge man keine Kopfhörer),""Adaptiv"" (Umgebungsgeräusche werden nicht so stark gedämpft, dafür hört man kaum bis keine Windgeräusche) und""ANC"" (Umgebungsgeräusche werden sehr stark gedämpft, allerdings hat man störende Windgeräusche, wenn man sich bewegt).Selbst das ""ANC"" ist für mich subjektiv von der Geräuschunterdrückung einfach nicht ausreichend, und ich bin regelrecht enttäuscht von den lauten Windgeräuschen. Die Option ""Windgeräusche unterdrücken"" in der B&O App bringt auch keine Abhilfe und setzt sich immer wieder zurück; der Support geht nicht darauf ein.Auch die Gestensteuerung (an der rechten Hörmuschel entlangstreichen zum Lied wechseln oder in einer Kreisbewegung die Lautstärke ändern hat bei den H9i wesentlich besser funktioniert als bei den HX.Positiv zu bemerken ist, dass es jetzt keine Schieberegler mehr gibt, die kaputt gehen könnten.Auch die Tonqualität ist noch einmal nach oben gegangen, hätte nicht gedacht, dass das möglich ist.Bluetooth ist auch stabiler und akkuschonender als noch bei den H9i.

Over the years, Ive owned multiple headphones from Bang and Olufsen. I gotta say I'm so disapointed. The previous H8 was an okay one. I was hoping for a sound quality upgrade but that didnt happen. The functions such as music turning off and on when you take off your headphones really improved. At point, but the sound is really horrible. My experience was like this. It sounds like you're listening to a music over the wall. Absolutely no bass. Somehow the vocals were really impressive. I like the headphones to be comfy. My H4 2nd's earcups are much softer. Hmmm why. I guess you get the build quality and the technology for this price.Hopefully someone reads my comment and reconsider buying these headphones. but at the same time, its my personal opinion so yeah

They are so beautiful, with luxurious materials, comfortable, and all, as expected.BUT:- completely useless if you wish to work on MS teams or make calls. That’s not what they are for. These are for listening to music.- The sound is very good but not as good as in Bowers and Wilkins PX7 (still better than the rest though)- The ear cushions are not as padded as in Beoplay H4 (H4 is more comfortable and over all better looking)- The finger controls on the side of the earcups are just terrible, mostly useless. Bring back buttons or make this work better.- multi pairing doesn’t work as it should. It messes up connections, volumes, stays connected when they are supposed to be off,  etc.Try a pair of Poly Bluetooth headphones and you will experience good calls and good multi pairing (but you won’t look as cool as with these beoplay HX!!!).- ANC is basically useless. My Jabra Elite 75 have much more effective noise cancellation. The difference between having ANC on or off is so little that I could never tell what mode was active

Ottimo  prodotto,  costruito in  modo impeccabile con materiali di pregio. Ottimo suono, che ognuno può  regolare secondo i propri gusti tramite app, che è l' unico neo di queste cuffie. Alcune  volte, ma raramente, l' app non trova le cuffie, che cmq funzionano  ugualmente. Rifarei  sicuramente  l' acquisto,  soprattutto al prezzo in offerta amazon  a cui le ho trovate io, 349 euro. Correggo  la recensione. App pessima,  sono più  le volte che non riconosce  le cuffie  che quelle che si collega.  Ogni volta, praticamente,  che accendo le cuffie, devo disinstallare l' app, installarla  di nuovo,  accedere, e sperare che riconosca  le cuffie. Le cuffie  in sé, sono stupende,  ma l' app fa perdere qualità  al prodotto  essendo pessima.

The best headphones I've ever owned. You have to embrace that they are not for running but nothing beats these bno's. The bass is exceptional. The midrange sounds are clear. They are great with phone calls. The construction is solid and robust. Struggle to go anywhere without them. This is coming from someone who owned the bass heavy Sony mx3s.

Ich hatte die Kopfhörer insbesondere bestellt, weil mir die Optik so gut gefallen hat. War aber leider vom Produkt selbst enttäuscht, so dass es zurück ging. Das hatte mehrere Gründe. Nummer 1: Der Sound ist okay, aber wenn die Bässe etwas stärker werden, irgendwie nicht überzeugend. Nummer 2: Der Bügel ist ziemlich schwer. Das finde ich sowohl für den Tragekomfort als auch für die Flexibilität des normalen Bewegungsablaufes einschränkend. Nummer 3: Obwohl das Modell explizit mit Apple-Konnektivität beworben wird, hatte ich mehrfach Verbindungsprobleme. Das nervt... Nummer 4: Bei meinem Produkt war leider die Touch-Funktion defekt. Da würde ich mir eine besser Qualitätskontrolle wünschen, aber selbst wenn sie funktioniert hätte, wäre mir das Produkt bei den bereits benannten Mängeln den Preis nicht wert gewesen. Dabei hatte ich es schon zum Blackfriday reduziert erworben. Also für denselben Preis lieber die AirPod Pros 2. Gen bestellt, die auch das Noice-Cancelling deutlich besser hinbekommen. Fazit: Für den Preis hätte ich mehr erwartet. Der telefonische Kundenservice von Bang & Olufsen war jedoch sehr gut, Lob dafür!

Ils sont carrément merveilleux! D’emblée je suis un grand fan de B&O, j’ai eu les H6 1rst Gen, H8 rst Gen, H9 1rst Gen, H9 2nd Gen et maintenant les HX. Les HX sont dans une ligue à part en se qui attrait à la qualité de fabrication. Aluminium anodisé, cuir véritable, étui de transport (ENFIN) robuste… Ils légers et confortables. La techonologie ANC que B&O propose est efficace. Ils ne sont pas premiers de classe en la matière, mais n’ont pas à rougir face à la concurrence.Out of the box j’avoue que je n’étais pas certain de la signature sonore des HX. Je les trouvais amorphes, sans vie. Mais il suffit de jouer avec l’equalizer via l’application de Bang & Olufsen et le tour est joué. Les basses fréquences prennent du coffre et les aiguës deviennent plus assumées. Si votre budget vous le permet, vous ne serai pas déçu!

Ich schreibe hier nur meine subjektiv wahrgenommenen Empfindungen. Der Kopfhörer überrascht mit einer Trageleichtigkeit die ich als sehr angenehm und beeindruckend empfinde ( geht in Richtung Grado GH2 den ich Zuhause verwende).Habe heute Nachmittag meinen persönlichen Hörgeschmack auf der dafür notwendigen App eingestellt und anschließend mehrere Titel unterschiedlicher Stilrichtungen mittels meinem mp3 Player gehört . Was ich da hörte war zum Niederknien. Ein Sound für Götter!Die Ohrschmeichler lassen Klangbilder entstehen ( entsprechend der persönlichen Stilrichtung) als wären sie von den berühmtesten Malern in Auftrag gegeben worden. Himmlische Sphären, irdische Mitten und ein höllischer Bass; alles so präzise platziert wiedergegeben wie es die Tontechnik aufgenommen hat. Ein musischer Genuss der bei einem Noise cancelling Kopfhörer seinesgleichen sucht.Mein Abendspaziergang entlang einer Eisenbahnlinie auf der mehrerer Züge der DB vorbeifuhren trübten meine Hörfreude, dank eines perfekt wirkenden Noise draußen bleiben Effekts, keineswegs. Eine für mich elegante Lösung ist das vor/zurückspringen der Musiktitel mittels wisch und weg am rechten Hörer bzw. Laut/Leise Turnaround am linken Hörer mittels Touch.Spotify über mein IPHONE war eine schöne Unterhaltung auf meinen Weg zurück nach Hause.Ich bin glücklich auf meine alten Tage endlich die Kopfhörer für mich gefunden zu haben die ich allen Musikfreunden und Liebhabern des guten Geschmacks guten Gewissens empfehlen kann. Mein Dank geht letztendlich an all jene Menschen die an diesem phantastischen Kopfhörer mitgewirkt haben. PS. Listen to the Music and enjoy yourself! Anspieltip: Immigration Song ( Led Zepp )

Ich besitze eine H95 und einen H9i mit denen ich die HX vergleichen konnte, zusätzlich auch die AirPods Max und einige andere aktuelle BT Hörer. Kurz zusammen gefasst, an die Tonqualität, das ANC und die Verarbeitung des H95 kommt der HX nicht ran, aber er überflügelt den H9i und ist deutlich näher am H95 dran als am H9i (Eigentlich fehlen nur einige Kleinigkeiten). Ich würde den Klang neutral ins leicht warme bezeichnen. Die Höhen sind im Vergleich zum H9i nicht mehr so überspitzt, die Mitten besser gezeichnet und der Bass schön knackig, aber nicht zu hervorgehoben. Insbesondere der Bass ist deutlich besser als beim AirPod Max. Das ANC ist besser als beim H9i aber schlechter als bei den AirPod Max oder H95. Wenn man also auf ANC Wert liegt gibt es sicher bessere, aber auch schlechtere. Mit aktivierten ANC wir der Bass ein wenig stärker, aber weit entfernt von Beats oder einem B&W PX7 Transparenz Modus ist ähnlich der AirPod Max wirklich sehr gut. Anders als beim H9i ist die Aktivierung deutlich einfacher über einen Knopf am linken Hörer, auch der Druckknopf für an/aus ist besser als der Schieberegler des Vorgängers. Im Vergleich zu den AirPod Max hört der Sitznachbar nichts von der Musik die man gerade hört.Auch die Verarbeitung ist nochmals deutlich besser als beim H9i und mindestens genauso gut wie bei den AirPod Max.Zusammenfassend hat B&O einen richtig guten Kopfhörer auf den Markt gebracht, dessen Verarbeitung mustergültig ist und den Vorgänger deutlich übertrifft. ANC ist sehr gut aber es gibt bessere. Wer auf einen sehr guten, nicht anstrengenden super detailreichen und neutral/minimal warmen Sound wert legt ist mit diesem Kopfhörer bestens bedient.

ホームページにはあらゆる曲にマッチ、と書いてありましたが正直言って低音が出ていなさすぎてロック系の音楽には合わないなと思いました。BeoplayEQ、BeoplayH95も所有していますが、比較してもHXの低音の弱さはダントツです。発売時期と値段からしてEQの音に近いかな、と思いきやE8に近い感じです。バランスの良いフラットな音、というよりは高音域寄り。クラシック等を聞くにはいいかもしれません。

Le casque est très confortable, le meilleur que j'ai essayé.  Le son est très bon aussi. moins basseux que Sony. (Je dispose d'un sony Wh-1000xm2).  Par contre l'ANC n'est pas au niveau.

Il masque le roulement du train et c'est tout. les voix, les annonces dans le train sont clairement audibles. Je suis revenu sur le sony qui a une meilleur ANC et avec lequel les bruits de train sont vraiment atténué.Il est bien pour être porté pendant de longue session de télétravail mais pas pour les transports.Je trouve dommage de payer 500€ pour un casque qui n'a pas une ANC au niveau d'un casque qui date de 2017.

I waited a week for this to arrive and was pretty excited. Once I received the item, I noticed there was no seal on the headphone box at all?? Not sure if this is due to b&o not putting a seal, or simply because someone has taken it off at Amazon. To my genuine surprise, there was nothing in the box! There was a manual on how to use the headphones and that’s all. I have tried starting a live chat or calling amazon and nothing works, it just doesn’t load. I’ve had to result in sending back an empty box for a refund. I am super frustrated as I brought these during the black friday sale and was excited for them. I will not be buying an item like this off of amazon again if this is the case. More protection is needed for such high value units! Customer obsession where?!

Extremadamente cómodos, medios y agudos fantásticos, y una calidad inigualable en comparación con todos los demás auriculares que probé (PX7, Aonic 50, Momentum 3, WH-1000XM4).

This brand new model has about the same sound as my 1st generation H4's that I heavily used since late 2018, that finally failed due to a missing plastic thingy, allowing to let the headband slide out.They're heavier, clamp down on the head harder and the new features are nothing to write home about, except maybe transparency mode.The wear detection feature is half baked at best and turns of podcasts whenever I move my head too fast during a walk on the beach.So, not great, overall. At leas t the headband issue is likely fixed, not sure whether I'll keep these long enough to find out.

Ich muss ehrlich zugeben, dass ich diese Kopfhörer bestellt habe, ohne die Marke zu kennen oder mich vorher groß mit ihnen auseinanderzusetzen. Ich höre allerdings in meinem Alltag sehr viel Musik und habe schon so manches Paar an Kopfhörern ausprobiert.Mein erster Eindruck war sehr positiv. Die Beoplay HX kommen in einer sehr stabilen, hochwertig wirkenden Tasche, in der sich Kopfhörer und Ladekabel sicher verstauen lassen. Die Kopfhörer selbst sind offensichtlich sehr hochwertig verarbeitet. Wo andere (selbst hochpreisige) Modelle vor allem mit Plastik verarbeitet sind, glänzen die Beoplay HX durch sehr angenehmes, der Haut schmeichelndes, mattes Metall. Dadurch wirken sie nahezu unverwüstlich, obwohl ich natürlich angesichts des Preises dennoch zu Vorsicht im Umgang rate. Die Größe der Kopfhörer lässt sich stufenlos und auf beiden Seiten unabhängig voneinander verstellen, was gerade mir als Person mit großen Kopf sehr gut gefällt. Das Design finde ich auch wirklich angenehm understated.Das Set-Up war denkbar einfach. Die Beoplay HX fanden die Verbindung zu meinem Handy via Bluetooth problemlos und ließen sich gleich einwandfrei nutzen. Bei mir führte es jedoch kurz zu Irritation, dass eine Mitteilung auftauchte, dass man die zugehörige App downloaden könnte, bei der der Link jedoch auch nach mehreren Versuchen ins Nichts lief. Die Bang & Olufsen App ließ sich jedoch ohne große Probleme auch so im Playstore finden und war im Nu installiert. Die Verbindung der App zu den Kopfhörern klappt auch einwandfrei, auch wenn mich zu Beginn etwas irritierte, dass diese Verbindung nur möglich ist, wenn man der App den Zugriff auf den eigenen Standort erlaubt (ich hätte erwartet, dass eine Bluetooth Berechtigung ausreicht, aber wer den Klang seiner Kopfhörer anpassen will, muss zumindest während die App läuft den Standortzugriff erlauben). Davon abgesehen ist die Bedienung der App sehr intuitiv und einfach. Es werden mehrere voreingestellte Soundprofile angeboten, die Lautstärke der Kopfhörer selbst (nicht zu verwechseln mit der Gerätelautstärke) kann angepasst werden und ein eigenes Soundprofil kann angelegt werden. Als Joggerin habe ich vor allem das voreingestellte Work-Out Soundprofil zum Laufen genutzt und war sehr zufrieden damit.Der Klang der Kopfhörer ist wie erwartet ausgezeichnet. Beim Hören einiger Songs meine ich auf einmal Hintergrundklänge heraushören zu können, die mir zuvor nie aufgefallen sind. Auch die Noise Cancelling Technologie funktioniert absolut einwandfrei, sodass man selbst durch die belebte Stadt navigieren kann, ohne groß beim Erleben der eigenen Musik gestört zu werden (aber auch ohne Gefahr zu laufen, herannahende Autos zu überhören). Ich glaube wirklich, diese Kopfhörer wären bei langen Zugfahrten ein Traum. Aber auch beim Training und beim Beiwohnen diverser Zoomsessions gefielen mir diese Kopfhörer bisher sehr gut.Für mich war der einzige kleine Wermutstropfen dann doch der Tragekomfort. Die Kopfhörer sind gewiss nicht die unbequemsten, die ich je getragen habe, aber trotz ihrer Preisklasse auch nicht die Vorreiter auf diesem Gebiet im Vergleich zu anderen Kopfhörern, die ich bisher ausprobiert habe. Menschen mit langen Haaren würde ich zunächst einmal raten, vorsichtig zu sein, dass keine Haare in die Scharniere der Kopfhörer geraten. Dies ist mir zum Glück nur am ersten Tag einmal passiert, seitdem passe ich besser auf, aber ich bin auf diesem Wege tatsächlich einmal eine Strähne Haar losgeworden - hier merkt man eben, dass das sauber verarbeitete Metall deutlich unnachgiebiger ist als so manches Paar an Plastikkopfhörern. Ich muss auch sagen, dass ich eine Weile brauchte, um die Höheneinstellung der Kopfhörer so zu erfassen, dass der obere Bogen nicht nach einiger Zeit began, etwas unangenehm zu drücken. Die Beoplay HX sind zwar an sich gut gepolstert, aber im Laufe etwa einer langen Zoomsession baut sich doch manchmal der Druck etwas auf. Man muss an dieser Stelle jedoch anmerken, dass ich wirklich einen relativ großen Kopf habe und meine Erfahrung da vielleicht nicht die aller anderen widerspiegelt. Wenn man die Beoplay HX immer mal wieder nachadjustiert, sodass der Bogen nicht immer auf die gleiche Stelle drückt, ist das auch kein besonders gravierendes Problem. Ich finde dennoch, dass man das für diesen Preis zumindest erwähnen sollte. Beim Laufen fand ich die Beoplay HX hingegen recht angenehm und mir fiel positiv auf, dass sie auch beim Schwitzen nicht verrutschen, wie das bei manch anderem Modell der Fall ist.---------------------------Zusammenfassend:Insgesamt sind das hier wohl klanglich gesehen zweifelsfrei die besten Kopfhörer, die ich je ausprobieren durfte. Sie klingen sauber und verleihen der Musik Tiefe, die ich sonst nicht kannte. Die Kopfhörer selbst und die App lassen sich leicht und intuitiv bedienen und es gibt viele Möglichkeiten, den Sound den eigenen Bedürfnissen anzupassen. Die Kopfhörer sehen gut aus und kommen mit einer hochwertigen Tragetasche. Die einzigen kleinen Mankos für mich sind die verpflichtende Standortangabe bei der Nutzung der App (wobei die Appnutzung wiederrum ein Muss ist, wenn man den Klang anpassen möchte) und dass ich finde, dass der Tragekomfort für den Preis noch etwas mehr im Fokus stehen könnte. Da ich finde, dass diese Anmerkungen jedoch im Großen und Ganzen verschmerzbar sind, gebe ich trotzdem gerne eine Empfehlung für die Beoplay HX ab. Wer klaren, individualisierbaren Klang möchte, ist hier bestimmt nicht falsch.

Die Beoplay HX sind für Wireless-Kopfhörer schon fast ein Vorbild: Sie sind sehr bequem, klingen gut, haben eine gute App inkl. Equalizer und sehen gut aus.Neben den HX liegt ein USB-A auf USB-C Ladekabel (ja, leider kein C auf C), ein Hardcase, sowie ein relativ kurzes 3,5mm Audiokabel bei. Ich habe den HX mit einem iPhone, MacBook Pro (beide mit Tidal und Apple Music) und einer PlayStation 5 getestet, wegen letzterer veröffentliche ich diese Rezension etwas später.Das eigentlich wichtigste zuerst: Der Klang ist super! Super neutral, aber wenn man möchte geht das in mehrere andere Richtungen durch die App (keine Desktop-Version erhältlich). Für den recht geringen Frequenzbereich (von 20khz) bis zu 22khz klingt es vor allem mit Tidal doch ziemlich detailliert. Das liegt wahrscheinlich an den Treibern und den Ohrpolstern. Als Codecs ist der Standard, also aptx, SBC, etc. dabei. aptx HD wird nicht unterstützt. Das macht bei der Frequenz auch keinen Sinn. Allerdings wäre ich sehr interessiert, was B&O hier mit 40khz+ und aptx HD o. Ä. auf die Beine stellen können.Mit angeschalteter Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) also Geräuschunterdrückung klingt der HX wie erwartet am besten. Das ANC macht einen guten Eindruck, ist in stiller Umgebung natürlich unnötig (Nachtrag: Zum Zeitpunkt des ersten Tests gab es einen Lockdown). Um die Baustelle vor der Haustür oder die Fluggeräusche im Flugzeug abzudämpfen, reicht es aus.Der Tragekomfort ist wie beworben sehr gut, bis perfekt. Das kommt natürlich an die Kopfform der Person an. Bei mir bleibt es meistens sehr gut, sogar nach mehreren Stunden (also wie es sein soll). Das Verstellen der Ohrmuscheln ist ähnlich wie bei den AirPods Max sehr smooth. Allerdings sind die Ohrpolster nicht für Sport geeignet. Das ist ein wenig schade, weil die HX nicht sehr viel wiegen und schon für Sport interessant wären.Die Akkulaufzeit ist mit etwa 30-35h ordentlich und nicht selbstverständlich.Zu den Features / Gimmicks:- Der Transparency Mode ist sehr gut und fast gleichauf mit dem der AirPods Max. Sehr hilfreich, natürlich eher für unterwegs.- Die Touch-Funktionen funktionieren leider nicht immer. Tippen wird meistens registriert, aber Streichen sehr selten.Mein Gaming ""Test"": Ich habe etwas mit dem Test gebraucht, weil ich erst einen geeigneten Bluetooth Adapter finden musste. Der HX unterstützt BT 5.1. Allerdings gibt es eigentlich keine Transmitter, die das (sowie die PlayStation) unterstützen. Es gibt billige mit leeren Versprechen...Deswegen habe ich zu BT 5.0 gegriffen, nämlich zum ""Gulikit Route Air+ Pro"". Das soll keine Werbung sein, aber lasst mich meine Erfahrung damit teilen: Er funktioniert mit dem HX, sogar recht gut. Das Mikrofon konnte ich noch nicht testen, das werde ich dann hier ergänzen. Eine kleine Verzögerung gibt es leider, weil nur aptx ausgewählt wird, nicht aptx LL (low latency). Eigentlich könnte der HX aptx LL unterstützen, da warte ich noch auf den Kundenservice. Update: Der HX kann NICHT aptx LL.Das war soweit das Positive, jetzt zu den Kritikpunkten: Das Preis- / Leistungsverhältnis schwankt leider, ich möchte mich aber vor allem auf den Frequenzbereich beziehen. Denn für fast 500€ könnte man wenigstens 40khz erwarten, die Konkurrenz mal außen vor gelassen.Um jetzt doch einen Vergleich (als Bsp.) zu nennen: Der Beyerdynamic ""Aventho Wireless"" & Wired klingt besser (vor allem mit dem Impacto von Beyerdynamic), als der Beoplay HX, kostet auch nur die Hälfte, ist aber nicht so bequem wie der HX. Der „Amiron Home“ klingt besser und ist sehr angenehm zu tragen, auch günstiger aber natürlich offen. Beide haben kein Mikrofon und sind nicht wireless. Es gibt beide aber in einer Wireless Variante, die anders klingt.Deswegen ist der HX meiner Meinung nach besser für z. B. Gaming gedacht, als für Musik. Aber halt- B&O hat doch ein ähnliches Gaming-Headset entwickelt, oder? Genau, nämlich der ""Beoplay Portal"". Einen sehr großen Unterschied sollten diese Geräte nicht haben, aber wenn Interesse an einem ""Premium"" Gaming-Headset besteht, dann probieren Sie bitte den Portal aus. Wer bereit ist diesen Preis zu bezahlen, der sollte es sich genau überlegen.Ich bin ganz ehrlich, ich empfehle euch beim Kabel zu bleiben und damit auch bei Kopfhörern wie dem Aventho Wired und vor allem dem Amiron Home (bester Kopfhörer, den ich kenne). Das klingt jetzt wieder wie Werbung, ich weiß, aber Beyerdynamic macht den Sound in diesem Preissegment (und in den anderen) einfach am besten.Falls B&O manche Dinge verbessert, sieht das natürlich anders aus. Noch kann ich den HX aber nicht weiterempfehlen; Ich empfehle dennoch jedem diesen Kopfhörer zu testen, das schadet keinem.Das kabellose Zeitalter ist noch nicht ganz hier. Plump gesagt kommt es erst, wenn jeder einzelne BT-Kopfhörer (bildlich gesprochen) Google Chromecast und (Qualcomm) aptx HD eingebaut hat.Warum vier Sterne? Weil es trotz des Preises ein sehr guter Kopfhörer ist und ich das Gesamtpaket genossen habe. Außerdem: Jede Ohren / Kopfformen sind anders, das muss man bei Audio immer beachten.Ich erwähne das eigentlich nie, aber ein kleines Heads-Up: Mir wurde der Beoplay HX für diese Rezension kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt. Ich habe hier meine Meinung und objektive Erfahrung unabhängig davon geschildert.

Für Eilige:Klang:  5 SterneAkkulaufzeit: 5 SterneDesign und Verarbeitung: 5 SterneBedienung: 4 SterneTragekomfort: 4 SterneNoise-Cancelling: 4 SterneTransportabilität: 3 SterneDas aktuelle Oberklassemodell der kabellosen Over-Ears des dänischen Nobelherstellers wagen keine großen und mutigen Designänderungen: wie schon Vorgänger und andere Modelle der Beoplay Serie ist der HX nicht zuletzt aufgrund des Runden Ohrmuscheldesigns, der großen Touch-Flächen der des großen B&O-Logos als solcher zu erkennen. Von dieser Seite nicht viel neues.Die Neuerungen finden sich denn auch eher im Detail: längere Akkulaufzeit (B&O verspricht bis zu 35 Stunden!), besseres Noise-Cancelling durch 4 Mikrophone, verbesserte Treiber und vor allem alle aktuellen Bluetooth-Standards inkl. verlustfreier Übertragung sollen den HX attraktiv machen.Neben den Hörer findet sich ein kleines (sehr kurzes) Audiokabel und ein USB-A auf USB-C Ladekabel. Das wertige Case aus Hartkunstoff schützt den edlen Kopfhörer beim Transport. Dieser lässt sich leider nicht vollständig zusammenfalten und macht sich im Rucksack ganz schön breit. Da macht sich die Konkurrenz doch deutlich kleiner.Über die Haptik kann man nicht meckern, im Gegenteil: Die verwendeten Materialen (Leder, Aluminium, hochwertige Stoffe) wirken edel und robust. Die Verarbeitung ist vorbildlich. Bei einem Vorgängermodell hatte ich schon mal nach kurzer Tragezeit kleine Risse im Leder der Ohrmuscheln. Diese konnte ich bei diesem Modell nicht feststellen.Wer den vollen Bedienkomfort des Beoplay haben möchte, kommt um die App für iOs und Android nicht herum. Nur hier lässt sich die Klangcharakteristik und das adaptive Noise-Cancelling fein justieren. Am Hörer selbst kann letzteres nur in drei Stufen durchgeschaltet werden.  Ein kleiner Kritikpunkt ist die Klangeinstellung nur in blumig betitelten Einstellfeld (Entspannt, Hell, Warm etc) einstellen. Ein echter (Band-) Equalizer wäre mir lieber.Die Bedienung ansonsten erfolgt über die großen Touchflächen der Ohrmuscheln. Titelsprung, Lautstärke lassen sich mit Wischgesten steuern. Mit etwas Übung funktioniert das sehr gut und sieht obendrein noch cool aus.Am Tragekomfort scheiden sich die Geister: Während viele Hörer der Mitbewerber gerade bei den das Ohr umschließenden Modellen auf ovale Ohrmuscheln setzten, bleibt B&O bei den kreisrunden Polstern. Bei sehr großen Ohren kann das unbequem sein, da das Ohr etwas abgeknickt wird. Ich fand den Beoplay sehr nicht zuletzt auf Grund des geringen Gewichtes (285g) sehr angenehm zu tragen.Das Noise-Cancelling ist auf hohem Niveau, wenn auch nicht Spitzenklasse. Rasenmähen mit einem Benzinmäher und Hörbuchhören war möglich, bei Musik drangen in dieser Extremsituation zu viele Störgeräusche durch. Im üblichen Stadtlärm dämpft es mehr als ausreichend, Musik hören auf der Rückbank unseres alten VW-Bullys war möglich, wenngleich ich hier schon wirkungsvollere Geräte hatte. Störend waren vor allem Windgeräusche, mit der der Beoplay manchmal überfordert schien. Der zum Vergleich zur Verfügung stehende Sennheiser Momentum 3 war hier effektiver, vielleicht nicht zuletzt vielleicht aufgrund der größeren Ohrmuscheln. Alles in Allem ist das ANC gut, aber nicht Spitzenklasse. Enervierend ist die zu empfindliche Trageerkennung. Selbst auf niedrigster Stufe stoppt sie beim Gehen sie Wiedergabe, obwohl der Hörer noch fest auf den Ohren sitzt. Hier hilft nur Abschalten.Wie klingt er nun: Zum direkten Vergleich durfte der B&O gegen den aktuellen Sennheiser Momentum 3 antreten. Die Klangeinstellung blieb auf neutral.Hier kann der Beoplay meiner Meinung nach punkten: Der Sennheiser trägt bei den Bässen eher dick auf. Der B&O gibt sich hier eher angenehm zurückhaltend. Der Bassbereich ist besser konturiert und deutlich straffer. Die Mitten sind gut durchhörbar, Stimmen haben ein angenehmes Timbre, und auch die höheren Lagen sind fein durchzeichnend und nie überzogen nervig. Im Vergleich mit dem Sennheiser ist der B&O insgesamt etwas kühler/ neutral abgestimmt. Beide klingen auf hohem Niveau. Letztlich ist die Abstimmung Geschmackssache. Dank der verlustfreien Bluetooth-Standards waren auch keine artifiziellen Störungen zu vernehmen, die mich bei Bluetooth früher nervten. Hat man sich einmal mit der etwas eigenwilligen Klangregelung angefreundet, bietet dieses einen weiten Bereich, den Klang an den individuellen Geschmack anzupassen und als Preset zu spreichern.Zuletzt muss man einfach die Akkulaufzeit loben: 35 Stunden sind kein leeres Werbeversprechen, der HX ist auch mit aktiviertem Noise-Cancelling ein echter Langläufer!

Ich liebe es wahrlich mit einem guten Kopfhörer auf den Ohren meine Lieblingsmusik genießen zu können und ich habe dazu in der Vergangenheit sicherlich eine ganze Menge guter bis sehr guter Erfahrungen mit eben guten und sehr guten Kopfhörern gemacht, aber im Segment der kabellosen Kopfhörer habe ich mit dem Beoplay HX meinen Meister gefunden.Und hiermit meine ich wirklich, dass Bang & Olufsen mit ihrem Beoplay HX wirklich ein Meisterstück kreiert haben, denn ich kann den Klang mit meinem fast doppelt so teuern kabelgebundenen Kopfhörer von der Konkurrenz vergleichen und doch wieder nicht, weil Beoplay HX allem die Krone aufsetzt.Der kristallklare Klang dieses superbequemen Premiumkopfhörers und seiner bis aufs letzte i-Tüpfelchen individualisieren Soundprofile toppt alles, was ich bisher ""gehört"" habe, wenn es um Kopfhörer ging.Noch dazu habe ich in der Vergangenheit mit Noise Canceling gemacht, die aber nicht daran kommt, was Beoplay liefert. Auch weiß ich jetzt, was es bedeutet die Musik zu hören und gleichzeitig aber seine Umwelt vollends wahrzunehmen,  denn auch hier spielt der Beoplay HX in der Profiliga und liegt dabei stundenlang einfach gut über den Ohren und drückt dabei nicht einmal leicht.Man spricht bei Bang & Olufsen von immersivem Sound und bitte meine Herren; ich kann mir diese Beschreibung zum Produkt nicht treffender vorstellen, denn diese Kopfhörer sind aus einer anderen Dimension. Wenn ich es nicht besser wüßte, würde ich ja sagen, dass Bang & Olufsen ein völlig neues, nie zuvor erlebtes Hörerlebnis ermöglicht und dies auch in Zukunft andere Hersteller versuchen wollen, denn der Beoplay HX stellt einfach alles in den Schatten, was zumindest ich persönlich bisher gehört habe!Was mich mitunter am meisten beeindruckt ist die Tatsache, dass ich bei meiner Lieblingsmusik wirklich jede Nuance heraushören kann, Instrumente, sämtliche Töne, Effekte...das Hörerlebnis war nie vorher so sehr ""direkt mittendrin"" wie mit diesen Kopfhörern. Per Knopfdruck kann man Die Welt mit diesen Noise Cancelling Kopfhörern völlig ausblenden, oder sie per Knopfdruck einfach wieder zuschalten und die Außenwelt wieder wahrnehmen. Dazu hat man an der linken Ohrmuschel einen kleinen Multi-Button.Wäre das nicht schon genug, steuert man die Lautstärke, den Skip zum nächsten oder letzten Song und eben auch die Soundisolierung, oder halt das Zuschalten aller Hintergrundgeräusche durch kleine Tasten direkt an Ohrmuschel, oder per Touch und Gesten über die Ohrmuschel selbst. Alles wunderbar perfekt und intuitiv gelöst!In Sachen Design und Haptik musste sich Bang & Olufsen ja ohnehin nie verstecken, aber auch hier setzt der Beoplay HX neue Maßstäbe, denn der Kopfhörer fühlt sich nicht nur großartig mit seinen leichten und angenehmen Materialien, sieht dabei blendend aus, sondern fühlt sich auch einfach nur großartig an!! Ein Designwunder, was man gerne in Händen hält, wenn man es denn dann mal vom Kopf nehmen will!!!!Selbst das von Bang und Olufsen beigelegte Case für die Kopfhörer hat echte Premium Qualität.Wenn es aber um das Quäntchen geht, was diesen Kopfhörer von vielen anderen seiner Art unterscheidet, dann ist dies die pure Ingenieurskunst und die Tatsache, wie hervorragend Soft und Hardware bei Bang und Olufsen zusammenspielen, denn nicht nur, dass der Beoplay HX schon von Hause aus mit einem hervorragenden Sound hardwaretechnisch ausgestattet ist, ist diese Hardware auf die eigenen Bedürfnisse nahezu punktgenau anpassbar, denn die B&O App macht dies möglich. Für mich das absolute Nonplusultra, was in heutigen Zeiten leider immer noch kaum einem Hersteller so klar zu sein scheint. Unverständlich! Hier holt Beoplay HX für mich das letzte raus!Ich höre meine Podcast im entsprechenden Soundprofil,was ich vorher etwas individualisiert habe, meine Musik im Optimum Profil und wenn es zum Workout geht, gibt es auch hierfür ein Soundprofil, was ich entsprechend angepasst habe. Und diese Anpassungen geschehen wirklich Punktgenau!!!Was gibt es noch zu sagen?Alles fühlt sich Premium an beim Beoplay HX, alle Tasten reagieren prompt, die Gestensteuerung läuft wie das heisse Messer durch die Butter und ich will diesen Kopfhörer gar nicht abnehmen.Was sich anfangs vielleicht etwas komisch anfühlen könnte ist, wenn man die Kopfhörer auf dem Kopf hat, ohne Musik abzuspielen, denn man spürt förmlich, wie Beoplay HX den Klang innerhalb der Muschel isoliert, denn die Außenwelt wirkt dann schon etwas steril abgeschottet! Aber, dieses Sounderlebnis will man ja, wenn man die Musik genießen will!Und das funktioniert ganz wunderbar mit einer Akkuladung für ca. 28 bis 30 Stunden, je nachdem wie viel man am und mit dem Kopfhörer und den Profilen spielt. Geladen ist der Kopfhörer auch binnen knapp 2 Stunden.Bluetooth funktioniert auch per Knopf und reagiert prompt, einmal gekoppelt muss ich mein iPhone nicht mehr anmelden und bin auch binnen weniger Sekunden wieder mitten im Song.Übrigens besitzt der Kopfhörer als zusätzliches Schmankerl sogar noch eine Standby Funktion, die intelligent erkennt, ob ich die Kopfhörer gerade trage, oder nicht. Nehme ich sie ab, gehen auch die Kopfhörer aus um, sobald sie wieder auf dem Kopf sitzen weiterzulaufen. Auch echt genial!!Ja, ich bin sehr parteiisch bei diesem Wundergerät, aber ich liebe es!! Jeder Musikliebhaber wird es mir sicherlich gleich tun, denn in der Preisklasse gibt es einfach nichts vergleichbar gutes, was so überzeugt!5 Sterne plus!!

B&O vient concurrencer les ténors que sont les casques Sony WH-1000M4 ou Bose NC 700 avec un tarif encore plus élitiste.Alors clairement tout respire le haut de gamme, à commencer par la housse rigide et son petit compartiment pour les fils qui offre une protection à toute épreuve. Il le faut bien tant le casque est lui-même d'une finition extrêmement qualitative : cuir d'agneau, mousse à mémoire de forme, alu brossé... irréprochable si ce n'est le rembourrage de l'arceau un peu ferme. Au final, le confort est vraiment très bon, particulièrement sur les oreilles et un port prolongé ne sera pas un problème.Comme pour tout casque bluetooth, il faut passer par une appli pour les réglages et la configuration. L'appairage se fait sans problème et le casque est vite reconnu bien que passer d'un appareil à un autre n'est pas bien géré... un peu pénible. L'appli est un peu lourde (74 Mo et des poussières) alors même que les menus sont peu nombreux : Quelques préréglages selon l'usage voulu, un équaliseur très bien fait (Beosonic), le réglage de l'ANC qu'il est possible d'affiner avec l'appli alors que sur le casque le bouton ne permet que de passer d'""activé"" à  ""transparence"" (je n'ai jamais vraiment compris l'intérêt de ce mode qui amplifie et déforme les bruits extérieurs) ou ""désactivé"" Quelques fonctions pas mal comme la détection de proximité qui met sur pause lorsqu'on retire le casque s'ajoute à une appli très ergonomique et épurée.Là où le bas blesse un peu c'est sur le tactile peu réactif et inutilement original : il faut parfois tapoter plusieurs fois pour mettre en pause quant au swipe rotatif pour monter ou baisser le volume, linéaire pour changer de plage, ce n'est pas vraiment une grande réussite ergonomique même si cela fonctionne globalement et c'est bien dommage pour des fonctions aussi essentielles -> une étoile en moins !Pour le reste la qualité audio est quasi parfaite : je teste toujours les casques et écouteurs avec le titre ""The league"" de Nasser, c'est un morceau électro qui fourmille de petits bruitages discrets, de basses et d'aigus bien distincts et d'une voix bien mise en avant. Ici c'est un sans faute, chaque détail est présent, l'ensemble est très clair et équilibré mais on peut envoyer plus de basses avec l'équaliseur si on aime le boum boum ! Le volume max n'est pas très élevé mais suffisant pour se faire quelques acouphènes si on aime... A noter qu'en filaire, le volume est encore plus maigre.Pour finir, la réduction de bruit active n'est pas aussi efficace que pour les meilleurs casques (j'entends encore un peu la frappe de mon clavier avec l'ANC réglé au max) mais n'occasionne aucun souffle et ça c'est le principal.Bilan : Un très très bon  et très cher casque, tout confort à la fois sonore et à porter mais avec une ergonomie (légèrement) agaçante.

Also ich muss sagen, dass das der beste Kopfhörer wäre, den ich je besessen habe.Warum das aber leider nicht so ist, erkläre ich im folgenden Text.Positiv:- Der Klang ist einfach genial. Ich hatte noch nie einen Kopfhörer, der so klar und gut geklungen hat. Die Bässe sind auch da, aber nicht zu dominant. Insgesamt ist das das Beste, was meine Ohren bisher hören durften.- Die Verarbeitung ist absolut spitze. Alles an dem Kopfhörer ist hochwertig verarbeitet und die Materialien fühlen sich auch hochwertig an. Für 500€ kann man das erwarten, aber einen derart hochwertigen Kopfhörer hatte ich bisher nie.- Man hat eine Hardcase Aufbewahrungstasche dabei, worin auch das USB- und das Klinkenkabel verstaut sind.- Die Active Noise Cancellation Funktion ist echt super und v.a. höre ich keinen Verlust beim Klang, wie man es bei anderen Kopfhörern oft hat. Ist es aktiviert, hört man von der Umgebung kaum noch etwas.- Der Akku hält sehr lange.- Er ist leicht und angenehm zu tragen.Negativ:- Die Ohrmuscheln dürften etwas größer sein. Meine Ohren werden nicht umschlossen, sondern die Ohrmuscheln liegen teilweise auf.- Jetzt der Hauptpunkt für meine Bewertung: TOUCHAlles muss heutzutage Touch haben. Im Auto gibt es immer mehr Touch und in anderen Bereichen auch. So auch hier bei dem Kopfhörer. Es gibt Bereiche, da machen Touchfunktionen Sinn und es gibt Bereiche, da ist es absolut fehl am Platz, so auch hier. Play und Pause geht noch mit einem einfachen Fingertippen auf die Ohrmuschel. Zum nächsten Lied springen oder zum vorherigen geht per Fingerwischen nach vorne oder hinten. Leider funktioniert das nicht immer. Oft pausiere ich, statt zum nächsten Lied zu springen und manchmal wische ich 5x nach vorne oder hinten und es passiert gar nichts. Ich schaffe es auch beim besten Willen nicht die Lautstärke per Touch anständig zu verändern. Nehme ich den Kopfhörer ab und sehe genau den Bereich, wo man im oder gegen den Uhrzeigersinn wischen muss, dann schaffe ich es wunderbar die Lautstärke zu verstellen. Habe ich den Kopfhörer aber auf dem Kopf, schaffe ich es nicht mehr. Manchmal klappt es und manchmal nicht. Man spürt einfach nicht, ob man jetzt den Finger da angesetzt hat, wo man die Lautstärke verstellen kann. Schafft man es dann doch die Lautstärke per Touch zu verstellen, dann ist das leider so ungenau, dass man selten genau die Lautstärke erreicht, die man gerne gehabt hätte. Ich stelle mich auch nicht zu doof an, denn ich habe es mehrere Personen testen lassen und die hatten alle die Probleme damit, die ich auch hatte. Das macht so keinen Sinn. Ich will die Lautstärke schnell und einfach verstellen können, was hier aber nicht möglich ist. Man hätte einfach 2 kleine Knöpfe oder ein Drehrad für die Lautstärke verwenden sollen und nicht die Touchfunktion, denn die funktioniert einfach nicht richtig.- Es liegt keine Anleitung bei, nur eine Kurzanleitung. Die ist aber wirklich sehr kurz. Ich weiß z.B. nicht, was dieser ""Multi-Button"" macht. Selbst auf der Homepage gibt es nur die Kurzanleitung.- Man kann sich eine App über einen QR Code in der Kurzanleitung herunterladen. Da wird von erweiterten Funktionen gesprochen. Ich habe sie heruntergeladen und installiert, weil ich dachte, dass da mehr erklärt wird etc. Nach der Installation wird man erst einmal aufgefordert sich bei Bang & Olufsen zu registrieren. Ich möchte mich nicht registrieren, um evtl. eine Anleitung zum Produkt zu erhalten oder mehr darüber zu erfahren. Wenn ich einen Kopfhörer kaufe, möchte ich damit Musik hören und mich nicht erst noch irgendwo registrieren.Ich finde es schade, dass der Eindruck eines derart super klingenden Kopfhörers durch die genannten Punkte getrübt wird. Für 500€ kann man aber wohl eine anständige Anleitung und Bedienung erwarten. Außerdem möchte ich mich nicht erst irgendwo registrieren, um meinen Kopfhörer zu konfigurieren und richtig nutzen zu können. Wer einen super Klang möchte und auf Touch steht, der ist hier genau richtig. Wer mit Touch an einem Kopfhörer nichts anfangen kann, ist hier falsch.

Queste cuffie Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX sono davvero il massimo in termini di confort e design, hanno uno stile davvero unico, suonano molto bene e hanno un'ottima cancellazione attiva del rumore, tuttavia, qualcosa non mi ha convito del tutto.Già dal packaging si intuisce l'alta qualità del prodotto, le cuffie arrivano all'interno di una confezione molto curata e minimale, la quale contiene:➡ la custodia delle cuffie;➡ le cuffie Beoplay HX già posizionate all'interno della custodia;➡ un cavetto USB-A/USB-C per la ricarica delle cuffie;➡ un cavetto jack da 3,5 mm;➡ una breve guida introduttiva e un foglietto con le dichiarazioni di conformità e le varie avvertenze.Le cuffie esteticamente si presentano davvero bene, esse sono realizzate con materiali di altissima qualità e hanno uno stile molto minimale e leggero.Complessivamente le cuffie sono poco ingombranti, leggere e non danno fastidio anche dopo averle indossate per molto tempo.Anche la confezione è poco ingombrante e molto maneggevole, può essere risposta in uno zaino senza occupare tropo spazio, inoltre anch'essa è molto leggera.Per quanto riguarda la qualità audio, posso dire che a mio avviso è ottima e in particolare ho apprezzato la qualità dei bassi.Queste cuffie permettono di apprezzare appieno tutti i suoni nei minimi dettagli, per questo suggerisco di utilizzare file audio di qualità non troppo compressi.La cancellazione del rumore funziona molto bene e si percepisce nettamente la differenza quando è attiva.Grazie alla cancellazione attiva del rumore, è possibile godersi la musica anche in ambienti con rumore di fondo fastidiosi, ad esempio in treno.L'app dedicata è davvero fatta bene, intuitiva e permette di personalizzare l'equalizzazione audio e altre impostazioni delle cuffie, come ad esempio la cancellazione attiva del rumore, la sensibilità dei sensori di prossimità, etc.La cosa che non mi è piaciuta è che al massimo volume e con alcuni settaggi audio a volte le cuffie si sentono un po' gracchiare e questo non va bene.Da premettere che stiamo parlando di un volume più alto di quello di ascolto medio e con un settaggio audio che aumenta ulteriormente i bassi, però per come la vedo io l'app non dovrebbe consentire di impostare una configurazione audio che distorce e compromette la qualità.Ad ogni modo, per questo motivo consiglio di mantenere la configurazione audio di default, in questo modo si evitano questi problemi.Il mio giudizio complessivo è abbastanza positivo perché ritengo sia un problema di equalizzazione, tuttavia per questo prezzo mi aspetterei delle cuffie perfette e queste, per via di quanto detto, non lo sono.

Cuffie che sono molto belle da vedere esteticamente, un design unico e con touchpad in alluminio sul padiglione per permettere il controllo della riproduzione musicale.All'interno della confezione si trova all'interno anche una custodia rigida per permettere di conservarle e portarle in giro senza farle rovinare, inoltre molto completa la confezione con i cavi usb per ricaricare le cuffie che si possono inserire all'interno della custodia.L'interfaccia tattile è molto reattiva ma la cosa che più sbalordisce è il suono limpido e pulito, si nota un audio professionale che permette di cancellare i rumori esterni, suono avvolgente e fa entrare davvero in un'atmosfera di relax, davvero un prodotto innovativo per chi ama la musica o vuole usare queste cuffie per lavoro.Per andare avanti o indietro con i brani occorre fare tutto in modo semplice e funzionale con un gesto sul padiglione esterno.Cosa che ho apprezzato è la funzione di cancellazione attiva del rumore ANC che si riesce ad attivare con un movimento dall'alto verso il basso, c'è inoltre anche la funzione Transparency Mode, cosa utile è che per vedere se le funzioni sono attive occorre vedere se la spia è accesa.La batteria dura davvero tanto e si ricarica in circa 2 ore per una ricarica completa, ho utilizzato le cuffie per una giornata senza problemi ed è stato davvero sorprendente il loro utilizzo , cosa che ho notato è che la batteria si può sostituire in futuro in completa autonomia ,quindi mi sembra davvero comoda questa funzione che ho notato anche se utilizzando frequentemente le cuffie non ho notato nessun problema e la batteria si ricarica con il cavo type c , tra l'altro molto presente sui nuovi dispositivi digitali.La cosa più caratteristica di queste cuffie è l'app BEOPLAY, dove si può ascoltare l'audio riprodotto con delle impostazioni personalizzate e sono presenti anche preset come ""rilassante"" ed ""emozionante"", davvero molto interessante.Il suono è molto nitido e ricco di definizione, grazie in particolare alla presenza del driver da 40mm e con impedenza di 24  Ω sono assicurati suoni senza distorsione.Il prezzo è abbastanza elevato ma si nota una qualità e una presenza di particolari che sono unici e sicuramente si tratta di un prodotto davvero professionale e da avere se si ama la musica o si vuole ascoltare la musica per produrre musica.

Hallo,habe lange überlegt was ich schreiben soll, ein Kopfhörer mit einer tollen Musikwiedergabe und einem wirklich gelungenen ANC, sogar telefonieren geht damit super.Nur leider gibt es da für mich einige erst mal den Kopfhörer selber betreffende Gründe des Unbehagens, hier z.B. die Sensortechnik die nicht wirklich immer und zuverlässig funktioniert, hier wären Sensortasten oder Taster vielleicht benutzerfreundlicher gewesen, auch die Ohrmuscheln selber könnten evtl. nicht jedem richtig passen, wobei ich selber keine Probleme damit hatte.Dann kommen wir zur Installation bzw. Einrichtung, diese ist sehr langwierig, auch die beigelegte Schnellanleitung war nicht sehr hilfreich, so macht man sich dann auf den Weg zur Bang und Olufsen Webseite. Hier findet man dann nach wieder etwas vergangener Zeit und Suche weitere Hilfe. Was schade ist das der Kopfhörer eine App erfordert, was auch schade ist ist die teils doch recht schwierige Bluetoothanbindung, aber hat man sich da dann durch gekämpft funktioniert alles soweit. Was ich auch merkwürdig fand, dass ich mir für einen Account bei Bang und Olufsen einrichten mußte.Nun ja, nun weiter zur Verarbeitung, hier ist wie ich finde alles in Ordnung, man findet tatsächlich keine Fehler und nichts wirkt irgendwie billig. Der Kopfhörer läßt sich gut anpassen und sitzt schön am Kopf, ist nicht zu schwer und das ANC leistet bei Umgebungsgeräuschen ganze Arbeit. Der Klang ist besser als bei allen anderen Kopfhörern die ich vorher hatte. Wer also besseren Klang möchte kann diesen hier bekommen.Als Fazit kann man sagen ein optisch und haptisch sehr gelungener Kopfhörer mit einem sehr gutem Klang, leider mit Abzügen in der B-Note wegen aufwendiger und langwieriger Installationsprozedur, und der teils nicht korrekt funktionierende Sensortasten, aber der Kopfhörer ist updatebar, vielleicht wird da ja zeitig für Abhilfe gesorgt. So wie jetzt kann ich allerdings nur wohlwollend 4 Sterne vergeben.

Den Beoplay HX merkt man vom ersten Moment an, dass sie absolut hochwertig sind. Öffnet man die Bang&Olufsen typische Verpackung, so findet man zunächst das Hartschalen-Transportcase. Dieses ist sehr edel und schön flach gehalten. Man fühlt regelrecht, dass man hierin die Kopfhörer sicher transportieren kann. In dem Case findet man neben den Kopfhörern (zu denen ich gleich komme) noch eine kleine Klappe hinter welcher die Kabel verstaut sind. Die Beoplay HX selbst sind qualitativ ebenfalls über jeden Zweifel erhaben! Ich hatte vor einigen Wochen die Apple Airpods Max, welche bis dahin die am besten verarbeiteten Kopfhörer waren, die ich je in den Händen hielt. Nun muss ich aber sagen, dass die HX hier nicht hinten anstehen. Ich würde sogar sagen, dass sie mir besser gefallen, da sie ebensogut verarbeitet sind, dabei aber etwas weniger klobig wirken und leichter sind, wodurch sie auch angenehmer zu tragen sind. Bei den Airpods Max (welche ich als direkten Konkurrenten sehen würde) hat mich auch sehr gestört, dass man sie nicht ausschalten kann. Klanglich fand ich sie auch ein wenig zu bassig und in den Höhen leicht zu zischelig (das ist nebenbei bemerkt bei den Max aber dabei Kritik auf sehr hohem Niveau!). Die HX sind hier über das Frequenzspektrum hinweg sehr neutral. Die Höhen sind leicht verhangen, hier würde ich mir etwas mehr Brillanz wünschen. Der Bass ist recht ausgewogen und detailliert mit einem Boost um 30Hz herum. Dadurch bekommt die Musik einen leichten Tiefbass-Boost, der aber zum Glück keine anderen Frequenzen überlagert. Die Mitten sind sehr klar und werden räumlich abgebildet. Gesang kommt wunderbar durch. Über die B&O App kann der Klang aber noch ein wenig angepasst werden. Ich würde mir zwar einen 10-Band-EQ wünschen, aber die App ist immer noch besser als nichts.Das ANC funktioniert super. Ohne Rauschen werden hier besonders tiefe Frequenzen rausgefiltert und mittlere sowie hohe Frequenzen stark gemindert. Auch der Transparenzmodus ist grandios und äußert realistisch. Hier sehe ich die Beoplay HX mit den Airpods Max fast auf einer Stufe.Die Akkulaufzeit ist mit über 25 Stunden ebenfalls absolut top.Preislich sind die HX sicherlich nicht günstig, jedoch bekommt man für sein Gels qualitativ einiges geboten und liegt trotzdem noch über 100€ unter den Apple-Kopfhörern. Zudem kommen sie im Gegensatz zu den Max mit einem super Hardcase, lassen sich ausschalten und per App im Klang regulieren. Bitte nicht falsch verstehen: Die Airpods Max sind wirklich absolut gute Kopfhörer, nur macht der Beoplay HX einige Dinge einfach besser bei ebenso tollem Klang. Von mir gibt es daher eine absolute Empfehlung.

Der Kopfhörer wird in einer stabilen Aufbewahrungsbox geliefert, in der es eine exakte Aussparung für die Kopfhörer, und ein verdecktes Fach für die beiden mit gelieferten Kabel, LINE IN (1,20 ) und Lade-USB (ebenfalls 1,20 m, USB-A- auf USB-C), gibt.Der Kopfhörer ist in drei verschiedenen Farben erhältlich (Anthrazit, Sand und Timber ) und besteht aus edlen Materialien (Metall [Aluminium?], Leder, Stoff). Er fühlt sich beim Auspacken zwar etwas schwer an, aber beim Tragen dann doch recht leicht (285 Gramm).Er trägt sich angenehm, der Bügel lässt sich verlängern und so an verschiedene Kopfformen anpassen, aber, es gibt immer ein Aber, nicht wahr? - die Ohrmuscheln sind zu klein und zu rund. Die meisten Menschen besitzen eben keine kugelrunde Ohrformen, sondern ovale, so dass diese runden Ohrmuscheln bei ihnen und auch bei mir nicht die Ohren umschließen, sondern auf ihnen aufliegen. Das führt nicht nur zu Hörverlusten, sondern ist bei längerem Gebrauch unangenehm schmerzhaft und führt auch zu starkem Schwitzen. Bereits nach ca einer halben Stunde kann ich schon richtige kleine Schweißseen auf ihnen sehen.Es liegt eine Quick-Start-Anweisung bei, die zunächst hoffen lässt, dass es auch eine ausführlicherer gebe. Nur ist das leider nicht der Fall. Es gibt einfach keine. Wer wirklich wissen will, wie sein teuer erworbenes Gerät funktioniert, muss sich durchs Internet wühlen oder die B&O Webseite befragen, aber auch dort steht nicht alles. Es gibt zwar eine ausführlichere Gebrauchsanweisung, die einem aber trotzdem nicht verrät, wozu der MF Knopf da wäre.Das erfuhr ich erst auf Anfrage (immerhin ist der Support schnell und freundlich). Hier die Antwort, was es mit der mysteriösen MF (Multi Funktion)-Taste auf sich hat: Diese ist dafür da, um den Sprachassistenten zu starten. Was aber nur dann funktioniert, wenn man die App geladen hat (zu der ich später noch kommen werde).Der Kopfhörer arbeitet mit Bluetooth 5.1, und verbindet sich schnell und problemlos, wenn auch nicht mit allen Geräten, was aber möglicherweise an denen liegen könnte.Weitere Funktionen am Kopfhörer selbst sind noch jener mysteriöse MF-Knopf und eine aktive, vierstufige, Geräuschunterdrückung (ANC – Active Noise Cancelling).Knopflos per Touch werden noch laut und leise, vor- und rückwärts, sowie Play/Pause am Kopfhörer selbst, bedient, alles aber eher umständlich und mit hohem Ärgerpotential, den Blutdruck zu steigern.Laut anderen Testberichten/B&O Webseite, wird ein effektiver Frequenzbereich von 20 bis 22.000 Hz bedient, und der Akku soll nach nur 20 Minuten Aufladen bis 35 Stunden halten, was ich bisher auch noch nicht ausgereizt habe.Ebenso soll der Akku wechselbar sein, nur konnte ich bisher nicht heraus  finden, wo er steckt und wie man ihn entnimmt.Ohne Aktionen schaltet der Kopfhörer nach 15 Minuten ab.Nun der Reihe nach zu den einzelnen Kritikpunkten:POSITIV:- Der Sound ist für meinen Geschmack sehr gut - warm, aber deutlich; ich kann plötzlich Instrumente hören, die ich mit anderen Kopfhörern nicht wahr nehme.- Die BT Übertragung ist hervorragend – auch im Nebenraum, sogar wenn dieser durch eine zweite Tür, da Flur dazwischen, getrennt ist. Kein Wackeln, keine Abbrüche, kein Rauschen,- und schnell und problemlos hergestellt.- Die verwendeten Materialein fühlen sich gut und wertig an.- Der Kopfhörer ist, bis auf die leidige Sache mit den Ohrmuscheln, angenehm zu tragen.- Die Möglichkeit, auch per Audiokabel verwendet werden zu können, ist praktisch.- Die BT Übertragung wird durch getätigte herein kommende Anrufe unterbrochen (allerdings nicht von alleine fort gesetzt)NEGATIV (und teilweise wirklich ärgerlich):- Die App. Nicht nur, dass die Unsitte, nicht alle Funktionen am Gerät selbst einstellen zu können, einfach nur nervt, ebenso die Tatsache, dass man sich registrieren muss, so funktioniert sie noch nicht einmal richtig.- Sie funktioniert nicht mit jeder Android Version. Unter 5.1 wurde sie noch nicht einmal im Store gefunden, unter 7.0 konnte ich sie zwar (sehr langsam) laden, die Verbindung zum Kopfhörer wurde auch hergestellt (BT), aber dann konnte der Menüpunkt „ Konfigurierung“ nicht aufgerufen werden.Mit Android 8.1 endlich klappte auch das Aufrufen der Konfigurierung, wenn auch diese selbst nicht so ganz. Ich kann zwar Klangbilder einstellen (Podcast, Musik, optimal, … die sich von einander nur kaum unterscheiden), aber die Lautstärkeregelung streikt.Die Einstellung des MF-Knopfes natürlich auch.- Da die App nicht (richtig) funktioniert, kann ich auch das Klangbild nicht ändern, was dazu führt, dass das Klangbild ""Telefon"" nicht eingestellt werden kann. Gesprächspartner klingen daher ausgesprochen dumpf, meine eigene Stimme wird ebenso empfunden.- Ergebnis: Die App lohnt nicht.- Es ist obendrein ärgerlich, dass sich diese Funktionen nicht am Kopfhörer selbst befinden. Die Klangregelung hätte sich locker, genau so wie die Lautstärkeregelung an der rechten Ohrmuschel, auf der linken unterbringen lassen, ebenso die Möglichkeit, verschiedene vorgegebene Klangbilder einzustellen (etwa mit Drücken der Mitte, so wie die Play/Pause Taste zB).- Nächster Punkt: die lästige, unzuverlässige Lautstärkeregelung durch Touch-  und Drehbewegungen an der rechten Kopfhörermuschel. Nichts gegen Touch, aber wenn man nicht sehen kann, was man tut, wird es schwer, besonders, wenn das Touchfeld flach ist und kaum tastbare Erhebungen aufweist, an denen man sich orientieren könnte.- Die Lautstärke wird durch Drehbewegungen geregelt. Es ist aber nicht angegeben, wo man ansetzen müsste. Die Ohrmuschel ist außen goldfarben und ziemlich mittig befindet sich ein schwarzer eingesetzter Kreis aus Kunststoff, der ganz leicht aufgeraut ist. Man regelt nun die Lautstärke, in dem man im Innenteil des Kreises die Drehbewegung ausführt, was mit mehr oder weniger Erfolg schon mal klappt. Meistens muss man sich plagen, um genau die Lautstärke zu erhalten, die man gerne hätte.- Vor- und rückwärts zwischen den Tracks erfolgt durch Hin- und Herbewegungen, die man aber ohne Hinsehen meistens mit der Lautstärkereglung verwechselt.- In der Mitte nun werden Pause/Play eingestellt. Auch diese Lösung leidet darunter, dass man nicht sehen kann und nicht fühlen kann, was man tut. Der Mittelpunkt wird daher eher zufällig als gezielt getroffen.- Hinzu kommt, dass trotz ansonsten guter und schneller BT Verbindung, ausgerechnet diese Taste nur sehr verzögert (länger als eine Sekunde) reagiert.Dh, man meint, man hätte noch nicht getroffen, drückt ein zweites Mal und unterbricht jetzt aber die Verbindung wieder, wenn man beide Male getroffen hätte.Bedaure, aber das ist eine selten dämliche Regelung.Fazit: Sehr guter Sound, angenehme Materialein, beinahe guter Tragekomfort, gutes BT.Leider ärgere ich mich echt über die Negativa (nicht viel sagender Quick-Start; unnötige und obendrein schlecht funktionierende App; unnötige, ärgerliche Registrierung, um an meine Adresse zu gelangen [ich will Musik hören, aber nicht ausspioniert werden], umständliche Bedienung; fehlende Funktionen am Kopfhörer selbst [wer will den ständig eine App anschmeißen, auch wenn sie mal funktionieren solle, um das Klangbild zu ändern?]).Wer die App nicht braucht, nur einen sehr guten Sound haben möchte (und kleine, runde Ohren besitzt), kann zugreifen. Allerdings erwarte wohl nicht nur ich bei dem Preis einfach ein funktionierendes Plug&Play nebst allen Bedienmöglichkeiten am Gerät selbst, und nicht erst tagelanges Suchen im Internet, zig Anfragen beim Support und dem ungutem Gefühl, für eine Adresssammlung missbraucht zu werden.Na, wenigstens ist der Support freundlich.

Die Bang&Olufsen Beoplay HX Kopfhörer wurden gut verpackt und direkt am nächsten Tag geliefert. Verpackt sind die Kopfhörer in einer praktischen Aufbewahrungshülle, welche sich mit einem Reißverschluss sanft öffnen und schließen lässt. Diese wird wiederum, zusammen mit einem Quick Start Guide und einer Anleitung, in einem ansehnlichen Pappkarton geliefert.Die Tasche ist natürlich nicht die kleinste, bietet aber aufgrund des Hartschalen Materials einen hohen Schutz. Für die Hörmuscheln ist eine extra Form „eingegossen“ wurden, sodass diese beim Transport nicht aneinander reiben können. Die Kopfhörer werden in der Tasche also sehr gut fixiert. Unter einem kleinen Deckel befindet sich das AUX zu AUX Kabel, sowie ein USB-C zu USB-A Aufladekabel.Die Kopfhörer fühlten sich schon beim ersten Mal in die Hand nehmen, außerordentlich hochwertig an. Hinsichtlich der Verarbeitungsqualität gibt es absolut nichts auszusetzen. Die ausfahrbare Schiene, mit der sich die Hörmuschel aus dem Bügel ziehen lässt, besteht komplett aus Aluminium. Das Verstellen der Hörmuschel geht also ganz leicht und ohne einen spürbaren Widerstand. Es gibt hierbei keine Raster, alles lässt sich individuell anpassen. Trotzdem halten die Hörmuscheln beim Tragen zuverlässig ihre eingestellte Position. Praktisch ist die dezente „Rechts“ und „Links“ Beschriftung im Inneren der Hörmuscheln. Diese sind ziemlich hilfreich, wenn die Kopfhörer noch neu sind und man sich noch nicht so wirklich auskennt. Mit dem Tragekomfort bin ich ebenfalls zufrieden. Der Bügel ist ordentlich gepolstert, sodass nichts auf dem Kopf drückt oder schmerzt. Die Hörmuscheln liegen zudem mit einem angenehmen Druck an den Ohren an und umschließen diese vollständig. Aufgrund des kompakten und filigranen Designs der Kopfhörer, sind diese zudem nicht besonders schwer. Und das trägt enorm zum Tragekomfort bei. So lassen sie sich ohne Probleme auch mal für eine längere Zeit am Stück tragen.Die Bedienung und Handhabung sind ziemlich intuitiv. Das Einrichten der Kopfhörer, zusammen mit meinem IPhone, war überhaupt kein Problem. Die Unterstützung von Apple Geräten verrät uns bereits der Schriftzug „Made for IPhone and IPad“, welcher auf die Umverpackung gedruckt ist. Nachdem Smartphone und Kopfhörer per Bluetooth gekoppelt wurden, verbinden sich die beiden Geräte nun sofort. Ähnlich wie das bei den Air Pods Pro der Fall ist. Eigentlich kann man jetzt schon anfangen, sich in das Sound Erlebnis zu stürzen. Es empfiehlt sich aber noch vorher die Bang&Olufsen App, welche sowohl für IOS als auch für Android verfügbar ist, herunterzuladen. Die App muss ebenfalls bei der ersten Verwendung mit den Kopfhörern gekoppelt werden. In der App lassen sich personalisierte Einstellungen treffen. So gibt es zum Beispiel einen Equalizer, welcher viele schon voreingestellte Szenarien beinhaltet. Natürlich lassen sich auch komplett eigene Equalizer erstellen und benennen. Obwohl sich die Lautstärke, sowie der Modus der Geräuscheunterdrückung, an den Kopfhörern selbst einstellen lässt, kann man diese Einstellungen auch in der App direkt vornehmen. Die Außenseite der rechten Hörmuschel ist Touch sensitiv. Hier lassen sich durch verschiedene Gesten Lieder wechseln, die Lautstärke einstellen, Musik pausieren, sowie Anrufe annehmen und auflegen. Das funktioniert alles wunderbar, wobei die Lautstärkeregelung anfangs ein wenig ungewohnt war. Um die Lautstärke anzupassen, wischt man in Viertelkreisen auf der Hörmuschel. Hierbei muss allerdings mehr Druck ausgeübt werden. Ansonsten reagieren die Kopfhörer nicht. Das hat zum Vorteil, das keine ungewollten Eingaben ausgeführt werden. An der linken Hörmuschel lässt sich der Grad der aktiven Geräuscheunterdrückung einstellen. Es gibt 3 Modi: Aktive Geräuscheunterdrückung, Normal Modus, Transparenz Modus. Mit der aktiven Geräuscheunterdrückung bin ich sehr zufrieden, da sie genau das macht, was sie soll. Sie ist vergleichbar gut, wie die der Air Pods Pro. Der Transparenz Modus empfiehlt sich dann, wenn man neben der Musik, alles um sich drum herum mitbekommen möchte. In der App lässt sich, neben einem automatischen Stand By Modus (Kopfhörer schalten nach 15min Nicht Benutzung automatisch aus), außerdem noch eine Trageerkennung aktivieren. Die Kopfhörer nehmen wahr, ob sie gerade getragen werden und pausieren die Musik, wenn sie abgenommen werden. Beim wieder aufsetzen spielt die Musik weiter. Die Hörmuscheln besitzen neben dem Ein/Aus/Bluetooth Paaring Knopf, noch einen Multi Button. Beim lange gedrückt halten, aktiviert sich bei Apple Geräten Siri. Ober er noch mehrere Funktionen beinhalt, wird leider nirgends beschrieben. Bei kurzem bzw. doppeltem Tippen auf den Knopf, passiert jedenfalls nichts. Deswegen gehe ich von keiner weiteren Funktion aus. Auf beiden Hörmuscheln sitzen noch ein paar Mikrofone, dessen Qualität ich bisher noch nicht Testen konnte. Des Weiteren ist in der rechten Hörmuschel ein AUX, sowie USB-C Port verbaut. Ein AUX sowie USB-C Kabel liegen dem Lieferumfang, wie schon erwähnt, bei. Auf einen entsprechenden 5V Adapter muss man leider verzichten, wobei den die allermeisten schon besitzen. Das Aufladen geht recht zügig. Die Akkulaufzeit wurde aber ein bisschen „aufgehübscht“, oder sie wurde bei sehr geringer Lautstärke gemessen. Denn nach einer halben Stunde Musik hören, waren schon 30% Batteriekapazität weg. Man muss aber auch dazu erwähnen, das ich basslastige Musik auf etwa 8/10 der Lautstärke gehört habe. Da die Produktbeschreibung allerdings eine maximale Wiedergabezeit von 30 Stunden verspricht, hat ich hinsichtlich der Akkulaufzeit etwas mehr erwartet. Aber gut, schlecht ist die Akkulaufzeit definitiv nicht.Ich habe in meinem Leben noch nicht viele preisintensivere Kopfhörer besessen. Um genau zu sein, besitze ich die Sony Over Ear Kopfhörer (ca. 130€) und die Apple Air Pods Pro. Die Bang&Olufsen liegen hinsichtlich der Soundqualität klar vorn. Falls man am Anfang noch nicht vom Sound überzeugt sein sollte, empfiehlt es sich unbedingt die App herunterzuladen und dort die Equalizer auszuprobieren. Denn diese beeinflussen das Hörerlebnis sehr. Die Musik ist über alle Bereiche hinweg glasklar. Wenn also der Bass einsetzt, brechen die Kopfhörer nicht ein und verschlingen keine Töne. Dies ist auch bei voller Lautstärke der Fall. Wobei man da mit dem Bass aufpassen muss. Wenn dieser auf Anschlag eingestellt ist, kann man logischerweise nicht mehr auf der höchsten Lautstärke hören, da auch diese Kopfhörer an ihre Grenzen stoßen. Da kommen wir auch schon zu einer wichtigen Feststellung. Und zwar sind eventuelle Bass Liebhaber nicht unbedingt bestens mit diesen Kopfhörern beraten. In den Mitten und Höhen sind sie wie schon gesagt perfekt und auch in den Tiefen haben sie einiges an Kraft. Jedoch könnte in diesem Bereich, für meinen Geschmack etwas mehr gehen. Die 130€ Sony Kopfhörer können, was den Bass angeht, fast mithalten. Jedoch sind sie natürlich in den Mitten und Höhen, sowie der generellen Lautstärke, klar unterlegen. Ich möchte den Bang& Olufen Kopfhörern hiermit keinesfalls den Wert absprechen. Aber es ist glaube ich wichtig zu wissen, das die Kopfhörer nicht unbedingt bestens für Bassliebhaber geeignet sind.Abschließend möchte ich nochmal erwähnen, das die Bang&Olufsen Kopfhörer ihr Geld wert sind. Sie sind absolut hochwertig verarbeitet, besitzen eine intuitive Steuerung (mit App) und bieten einen hohen Tragekomfort. Das Musikeerlebnis ist jedes Mal auf‘s neue ein Vergnügen. Nur an Bass fehlt es ein kleines Quäntchen, was den allermeisten aber garnicht fehlen wird.

Selten habe ich mich mit einer Bewertung so schwergetan, wie bei diesen Kopfhörern.Einerseits ist der Klang genial, andererseits nerven einige Dinge aber schon sehr. Möglicherweise liegt es auch daran, dass ich keine ausgesprochene Technik – Liebhaberin bin.Wozu brauche ich bei einem Kopfhörer eine App? Ich benutze seit 40 Jahren Kopfhörer, eine App war da nie von Nöten.Ich bin hin – und hergerissen von 5 Sternen für den brillanten Klang und 2 Sternen wegen teilweise nerviger Bedienung.Positiv:Natürlich ist da der brillante Klang. Seit 40 Jahren benutze ich Kopfhörer von SENNHEISER und war immer zufrieden. Der Klang dieses Kopfhörers ist nicht besser, aber absolute Spitzenklasse.Bässe, Höhen, Tiefen…alles kommt in einer fantastischen Soundqualität herüber.Das Tragegefühl ist recht angenehm. Die Ohrmuscheln sind nicht zu klein und liegen sehr gut an.Die Qualität ist über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Das erwarte ich von diesem Preis aber auch. Ich möchte nicht 500 € zahlen und nach einem Jahr sind die Ohrmuscheln „abgewetzt“.Neutral:Die App. Ich verstehe es immer noch nicht, aber egal.Die Verbindung per Bluetooth ist dagegen natürlich notwendig und funktioniert sauber und störungsfrei.Ein wenig nervend sind diese Touch – Tasten. Aber das ist wohl auch wieder Geschmackssache. Ich finde sie ungenau und frage mich, wie lange diese Funktion hält.Negative Dinge gibt es nicht und ich kann auch zur Technik wenig Neues beitragen.Für mich muss ein Kopfhörer einen tollen Klang haben und einen bequemen Sitz der Ohrmuscheln.4 Sterne.

Bang et Olufsen... la fameuse marque qui depuis des décennies mise autant voire plus sur l'esthétique de ses produits que sur leurs qualités audiophiles. Quand j'étais ado, arrivé chez un copain dont les parents avaient une chaine B&O signalait presque à coup sûr qu'ils n'y connaissaient rien en musique mais souhaitaient impressionner leurs visiteurs !Jugement injuste. B&O a aussi créé des produits excellents, mariant une esthétique un peu surannée à de vraies qualités audiophiles.Ce casque en est un exemple parfait. Je le dis tout de suite : je le trouve beaucoup trop cher. On paye la marque, on paye le design hyper-soigné et aussi des parti-pris techniques pas forcément aboutis, comme les surfaces tactiles qui permettent entre autre de régler le son sur les oreillettes. Au début, ça ne marche pas toujours, c'est capricieux. Et puis on s'habitue, on découvre et on acquiert les bons gestes, et là ça devient vraiment une expérience de qualité. Et c'est tellement pratique, de ne pas avoir à ressortir le smartphone de la poche.Je trouve l'ANC très efficace pour un casque de ce genre, je n'ai pas pris le métro avec cela dit, mais en balade en ville on se sent bien isolé, trop même parfois, quand il s'agit de faire attention au trafic.la qualité de construction est irréprochable dans les moindre détail, ça respire le haut de gamme par toutes les matières, tous les joints, un vrai plaisir. La conception de l'arceau le rend très agréable à porter, on l'endure des heures sans gêne.Et le son : eh bien c'est la surprise pour moi, il est vraiment très bon ! L'application permet de l'optimiser mais le réglage par défaut est déjà parfait : équilibre, profondeur, étagement des plans sonores, courbe de réponse sans bosses évidentes, c'est quasiment un Beyer Dynamic DT990, mais sans fil et doté d'une fonction micro et prise d'appel ! Cinq étoiles, malgré son prix astronomique. Si vous avez les moyens, c'est un excellent choix. Et il a une sacré ""gueule"" !

PREMESSA :sono molto appassionato di prodotti audio e sono sempre alla ricerca di buone cuffie cablate o wireless per ascoltare musica.Provo a darvi le mie valutazioni secondo questa scaletta che solitamente utilizzo:INDOSSABILITA' --> queste cuffie pesano 287 grammi e certamente non sono le più leggere in circolazione però, con i padiglioni in memory-foam di pelle di agnello, le ho trovate confortevoli anche per sessioni prolungate (almeno 3/4 h) , l’archetto superiore è ben imbottito e la pressione verso i padiglioni auricolari è giusta : promosse per comodità.COMANDI --> in queste cuffie c’è una superfice touch sul lato dx con cui è possibile controllare tutto con degli “swipes” : skip avanti, indietro, assistente vocale, ANC, Ambient sound, play, pausa, rispondi/chiudi il telefono ed il controllo volume : ottime da questo punto di vista. Avrei apprezzato molto una voce-prompt che avvisa quando l’ANC e l’ambient-sound è attivo ma purtroppo manca..BATTERIA --> impossibile scaricarle, durata della batteria perché 35h con ANC attivo, diventano anche 40h senza ANC.QUALITA' COSTRUTTIVA --> direi Premium, considerate che sono Bluetooth V5.1 e sono abilitate ai codec Aptx HD e  Aptx Adaptive per utenti Android ed AAC per gli utenti Iphone per uno streaming ad alto bit-rate, hanno tutte le finiture in pelle ed alluminio, nella confezione c’è anche un cavo per l’ascolto della musica “cablata” con il jack da 3,5mm. Purtroppo non possono essere ripiegate per ridurre gli ingombri all’interno della custodia rigida che è presente in confezione (abbastanza grossa ho postato le foto con un altro case per darvi un’idea). E’ inoltre disponibile un APP da scaricare sul playstore con cui è possibile personalizzare/equalizzare la nostra musica. La funzione ANC abbatte circa il 75/80% dei rumori a bassa frequenza ( SONY arriva al 90%) e la funzione Ambient Sound è sviluppata bene ed i suoni che vengono raccolti risultano naturali ..segnalo però che ho sentito un po' di “rumore bianco” quando questa è attiva.QUALITA' DEL SUONO --> qui ragazzi c’è il vero motivo per cui acquistare queste cuffie : se amate i bassi queste cuffie li hanno potenti e profondi quando il brano lo richiede, le frequenze medie sono rappresentate in modo preciso ed incredibilmente dettagliato (voci femminili e strumenti), quelle alte sono brillanti : per i miei gusti è un sound fantastico, ho avuto la sensazione che fossero cablate..SOUNDSTAGE--> la sensazione è quella di stare in una ambiente ambio, sembra di stare in una sala concerti di taglia grande in cui i suoni arrivano da più direzioni e senza perdita di dettagliPRO • Sound grandioso e, per quanto possibile, comparabile a cuffie cablate• ANC e Ambient Sound implementati molto bene• Cura costruttiva e dei materiali• APP che consente ampia personalizzazione delle cuffie (anche per futuri aggiornamenti software)• Sono multipoint ( possibile restare collegati a 2 device contemporaneamente)CONTRO • Prezzo di 499,€ al momento della recensioneCONCLUSIONI --> da un brand come Beng & Olufsen avevo delle aspettative molto alte che onestamente sono state rispettate. Mi rendo conto che il prezzo di acquisto non è molto abbordabile però, ho ascoltato dei brani Jazz dove sono riuscito a cogliere sfumature che solo le cuffie cablate mi permettevano di sentire : se avete il budget per acquistarle : consigliate al 100%Mi permetto un Suggerimento : fatele suonare per 15/30 minuti a “vuoto” prima di giudicarle, passato questo tempo direi che sono pronte per l’utilizzoSpero di essere stato d’aiuto

Are these worth £450? No, I don't think so. You're paying a big brand premium here.Sure, the sound quality is first class - easily as good as my Bose headphones. But it's the high cost that's offputting.If you're buying these for the ANC, my advice is to test them out in person before buying. The ANC has been disappointing on every single pair of headphones I've tried, even expensive ones like these.These are very lightweight, surprisingly so, which adds to their comfort.35 hours of battery life is pretty decent.Overall, I could only recommend these to dedicated B&O fans, due to the extremely high price.

Certes, le prix peut décourager beaucoup de monde, à juste titre sans doute, mais ce casque de la prestigieuse marque Bang & Olufsen ne démérite jamais et reste fidèle à la réputation sans faille de la marque.Tout, dans ce casque, respire le haut de gamme et le sérieux de fabrication, sans même parler de la qualité des matériaux de fabrication, irréprochable elle aussi. C'est un marché où la concurrence est rude, mais B&O relève le défi sans broncher le moins du monde.Le confort du produit est vraiment impressionnant ; c'est certainement le casque le plus confortable que j'ai porté dans toute ma vie. Il ne donne pas mal à la tête.L'appairage et l'autonomie sont parfaits.L'équilibre entre suppression du bruit ambiant et qualité du son (le défi le plus difficile à relever) est à mon humble avis presque parfait. L'A.N.C. fait très bien son travail, et ce sans endommager ce que vous écouter. N'oubliez pas que la marque a pour fer de lance la HIFI (même si les fichiers MP3 n'en sont pas). Le son est magnifique, ample et très dynamique.B&O fait dans le prémium avec talent, comme toujours.

As soon as you take the Beoplay HX headphones out of the case the build quality is evident. As expected from B&O, the materials look and feel fantastic, the aluminium solid, etching precise, the design is minimalist, simultaneously classic and modern, very high end. The pads sit comfortably over the ears and, together with the padded headband, facilitate a pleasant listening experience for extended periods. Battery life is excellent, even with ANC on, and the headphones have proximity detection so that audio stops when they are removed.The sound is clear and well defined, balanced and neutral. Bass response is deep without overpowering, each note precise; mids and highs are clear and bright with lots of space and dynamics. The HXs cope well with dance music sub-basses, busy metal and jazz, acoustic guitars, brass; really whatever you throw at them, with a clarity and separation, a directness, which is really impressive.ANC performance is good and there is little noticeable affect on the audio when switching between ANC and transparency modes. Switching is done from a button on the left unit which also has a multi-function button which can be used for voice assistant. The right unit houses the power button, and sockets for USB-C charging and 3.5mm audio cable (which apparently only works when the headphones are charged, although I suspect many, like me, will rarely use it). The right side also has touch controls for play/pause, skip track and volume (a circular motion which is a little quirky but works fine, once you get used to it). My over-ear headphones of choice for the last few years have been Sony WH-1000XM3 which have fantastic noise cancelling performance. The B&Os are close to matching the Sonys, not quite, but close. However, in every other respect it would appear to be time to retire the Sonys, which suddenly feel very plasticky.The companion app is also minimalist, comprising sliders for column and ANC, and a grid containing five sound presets and a selector to create others. You can have many presets although only five will appear on the grid, the others hidden; I suspect five will be sufficient.These headphones are very expensive but they are quality. I have a B&O hifi system which is at least 30 years old and it still performs superbly. I suspect the HX headphones may well be long-serving and so the metric moves from cost to value and I believe these headphones deliver value.

C'est un casque audio sans fil avec réduction du bruit, de la marque danoise Bang & Olufsen, réputée pour la qualité de ses produits audios.Il est de type circum-auriculaire.Un étui rigide est fourni pour le rangement et le transport.Il se connecte via Bluetooth, mais on a aussi la possibilité de se connecter via un câble Jack classique, ce qui est pratique pour une utilisation avec un vieil appareil ne disposant pas du Bluetooth. Le casque prend en charge le Bluetooth Multipoint, on peut ainsi connecter deux appareils en même temps.Il est très léger et confortable, même après avoir été porté pendant de longues heures. Ses coussinets en mousse à mémoire de forme recouverts de cuir y sont pour quelque chose.On peut l'utiliser pour faire des appels audio (il est muni de plusieurs micros) ou des visioconférences.La qualité sonore est excellente, que ce soit les aigus ou bien les graves, on est vraiment dans du haut de gamme. La fonction pour la réduction de bruit fonctionne aussi sans heurt et est vraiment efficace.

Me ha parecido sublime la calidad que poseen estos auriculares de Bang&Olufsen. Es la primera vez en mi vida que tengo la oportunidad de probar unos auriculares de esta marca, y digo con toda la certeza del mundo que son los mejores auriculares que he probado.Desde el mismo momento que te llega, se nota una calidad y unos acabados que las marcas normales de auriculares no tienen, Siendo una caja realmente bonita, muy sencilla y teniendo una experiencia de desempaquetado muy buena, digna de unos auriculares de gama alta como son en esta ocasión. Una presentación sencilla, y nada más abrir la caja nos encontramos con una muy buena funda protectora rígida, con los auriculares y sus accesorios en su interior.Lo primero que notas nada más sacarlos de su bolsa es la calidad de acabados que tiene. Según huele y he leído a posteriori en sus especificaciones, es que están hechos de piel de cordero, además de espuma con memoria, por lo que son verdaderamente cómodos de poner. Una vez que te los pones hasta apagados, lo que notas es que su cancelación de ruido es absoluta.Una vez los enciendes, la tecnología de cancelación activa de ruido es absoluta. Cuentan con Bluetooth 5.1, altavoces de 40mm con imanes de neodimio, USB-C, entre otras características. Pero por supuesto lo más importante y lo mejor, además de sus acabados, es la calidad de sonido que tiene.Espectacular. Sin palabras me deja cada vez que utilizo estos auriculares. No he necesitado bajarme ninguna aplicación complementaria para utilizarlos. Su calidad de sonido, volumen, cuerpo, bajos, medios.... todo. Son un 10 en mi opinión, parece como que no hubiese estado escuchando esta música y todas sean nuevas para mí. Y eso que lo he utilizado con el Bluetooth de mi móvil. Cuando lo he conectado a mi PC gracias al cable que incluye Jack, la experiencia ha sido más que satisfactoria.Cuenta con botones en la parte inferior de los auriculares, para controlar el volumen, apagarlos y encenderlos y poner el modo cancelación de ruido, el cual es sorprendente. Los click, los botones y absolutamente todo está acabado perfectamente.No son unos auriculares económicos, pero son unos auriculares absolutamente TOP. Quien quiera lo mejor, esta es su opción.

The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX Headphones (Model# 1224000) are a set of top-of-the-range high-end headphones delivering proper audiophile sound quality.I’m not going to deliver chapter and verse about Bang & Olufsen and the highly-respected quality of their products. If you’ve found this listing, if you’re reading these reviews, then you no doubt already know all about B&O. So, let’s get straight on with the headphones at hand.They arrive in a stylishly sleek and understated box which echoes the overall ethos of the brand. Nothing showy. It’s all about the sound. All about the quality. Precision. Attention to every detail. Beautifully, classically, stylishly understated.Inside the box you have the headphones, a zip-close hard carrying case, and the usual charging leads and instruction manuals.Set up of the headphones is an absolute doddle. It’s the usual Bluetooth pairing where you’ll need to press and hold the pairing button on the headphones then go into Bluetooth setting on your device and select “Beoplay” to pair. That’s it.You can also download the Bang & Olufsen App on your phone (or whatever) so you can change the “listening modes” and play with the sound equalisation etc of the headphones via that app.  Trust me, this is absolutely worth it and really does enhance the overall listening experience with the headphones by adjusting to your surrounding etc.Anyway, with everything set up and linked and fully charged blah blah blah…what are the darn headphones like? Well, quite simply, they’re the absolute nuts.  The noise cancelling is as good as if not better than Bose noise cancelling.  There’s absolutely no bleeding of the outside world into your self-created audio bubble. Just you and whatever you’re listing to. Just perfect.The sound reproduction is breath-taking. Acoustic notes are natural, full of blood and soul. Acoustic guitars sing with a thick and full sound that warms the heart. Electric guitars sound like a chugging, powerful force of will. Live performances are raw and crisp. Mastered albums show the layers, the depth of the songs.Bass isn’t supped up like the kids these days love. Instead it’s true to the records. Thick, bold, deep and rooting the songs to the floor.Every note is discernible. Every layer can been heard, listened into, identified and enjoyed. Like a aged single malt, songs can be enjoyed for the sheer beauty of their many layers. The complexities. And the love of sound.The headphones deliver up to 30 hours of playtime. Yeah, you read that right. Although with the active noise cancelling and the volume up a bit etc, this probably won’t make 30 hours. Nevertheless, anything in that sort of region is damn impressive.All in all I can quite happily say these are now my favourite headphones. I have Bose, Sennheiser, Sony, and Phillips sets.  These though. These are spectacular. Just love the sound. Love it.

Die Kopfhörer wurden sehr schnell geliefert und kamen gut verpackt und unbeschädigt bei mir an. Schon beim Auspacken merkt man, dass es sich hierbei um ein hochwertiges Produkt handelt. Die Verpackung ist ähnlich wie bei Apple Produkten ein sehr stabiler hochwertiger Karton. Innen befindet sich die Tasche inklusive der Over-Ear Kopfhörer. In der Tasche ist auch ein extra Fach für die Kabel enthalten.Einen Vergleich mit ähnlichem Kopfhörern habe ich leider nicht. Bis jetzt habe ich keine AirPods von Apple immer genutzt und war der Meinung, dass der klang hier schon sehr gut ist.Das ist aber kein Vergleich mit diesem Produkt hier. Die Verarbeitung der Kopfhörer ist tadellos.Das Paaren  über Bluetooth ging auch sehr einfach, hierfür gibt es auch eine extra App. In dieser kann man dann auch die Höhen und Tiefen und auch den Bass individuell steuern. Und das war eine Funktion, die mich wirklich überrascht hat.Auch das Noise cancelling habe ich in der Art bis jetzt bei Kopfhörern noch nicht erlebt. Schon beim normalen aufsetzen ohne Musik hört kein sein Umfeld nur noch gedämpft.Die Kopfhörer sitzen perfekt ohne auch nach stundenlangen Tragen unangenehm zu werden.Noch nie habe ich meine Musik so intensiv wahrgenommen und mittendrin miterlebt.Und als wäre das noch nicht genug, setzt Bang&Olufsen noch einen drauf und man kann über Touch seine Musik steuern. So geht es einzustellen, ob man es lauter oder leiser möchte oder man kann pausieren aber auch zum nächsten Lied wechseln.Sobald man während des Musik Hörens die Kopfhörer abnimmt, pausieren sie automatisch. Und wenn man sie wieder aufsetzt, spielt sie dort weiter, wo sie aufgehört hat.Der Preis mag zunächst etwas hoch erscheinen, aber die Qualität ist es definitiv wert. Für vergleichbare Produkte anderer Hersteller zahlt man mindestens den selben Preis.Die Qualität hat mich hier vollkommen überzeugt. Daher gebe ich auch 5 Sterne.

This is one heck of a set of headphones. They are very high quality - but at this pricpoint you should expect nothing less. They come very well packaged and presented in a cardboard box. Inside the box you will find a black zipper case which contain the headphones, charging lead and separate 3.5mm audio lead. Also a printed card with quick setup instructions.Upon opening the zipper case, the headphones are first revealed and they look beautiful. They are quite lightweight but very well made. Only thing I do not like at this point is the large L & R which is printed inside the ear cups. This I find really cheapens the look.The left cup has the following buttons:• Active Noise Cancelling / Transparency Button• Multi Button (Which I am struggling to find the use of)The right cup has the following buttons:• Power button (Short press on/off and long press Bluetooth Pairing)• USB input for charging• 3.5mm Audio Line in socket.Also on the right ear cup is the gesture area where you can control play/pause, Next / previous track and Volume up/down by simply tapping or swiping in the desired direction.The Quick Start guide prompts you to download the Bang & Olufsen app. Not a problem to download (it is 74MB from the app store). Once downloaded you will have to create a B&O account, which I did. However, all attempts so far to get the app to recognise the headphones has proven impossible. I have uninstalled the app, reinstalled the app - nothing. Despite being connected to my phone via bluetooth, every attempt to link the headphones to the app returns a ""Unable to find Beoplay"" error. Very frustrating indeed.So, it was left for me to test the headphones by running my usual music app on my phone.First time of wearing the headphones I was struck by how soft and comfortable the lambs skin and memory foam cups are really good. No issues with wearing these for extended periods.Sound quality is exquisite. Very clear with very little equalisation required. The really sound remarkable. The ANC/Transparency button is easy to find while wearing and a quick press results in changes to the mode. However, there is no audible confirmation of this to let you know which mode you are currently in. No biggie for me as the ANC is actually adaptive so adjusts itself depending on your surroundings.Battery life is excellent too. A boasted 40 hours of play time with a bluetooth connection alone, and 35 hours with ANC in operation. I have been listening off and on for well in excess of 30 hours now and they are still going strong. Charging is easy and convenient too by means of the supplied USB-C cable.I have dropped a single start from this review simply for the problems I am having with the dedicated Bang & Olufsen app. If you are paying this much for a set of what are truly superb headphones, then you should be able to rely on the dedicated app which is made by the same company especially for this set of headphones.Other than that I simply can no fault them. They really are the best I've ever had the pleasure of owning, and I do also have £400+ sets to compare them with.

My first ever B&O headphones, “built for comfort” says the blurb, oh and they are very, very comfortable, so on that front they’re off to a good start.There’s no doubt that these are exceptionally well built, aluminium cups and headband, soft memory foam pads surrounded in lambskin - these are exceptionally comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend them for exercise however, as they don’t clamp too tightly so regular head movements would cause slippage and the pads (though comfy) are not massively breathable so ears could get sweaty. The underside of the headband has fabric padding with shaping to rest comfortably on the head.Sound is excellent and customisable with the B&O app - a ‘dial’ which tells you what you are altering when you move it around (reduced treble, increased bass, etc).ANC is decent and performs best in ‘static’ environments where there is a constant noise (so on the train/bus, in an office etc) it seems to struggle where noise is infrequent (so near a road without much traffic - the ambience is handled well but the intrusion of a vehicle passing is not reduced as much) and in windy environments you do get the wind noise as it hits the ANC mics (not massively but enough to distract). The level of ANC is also customisable in the app.There is also a hear through mode (again, customisable in the app) which works well - one button to cycle through ANC, hear through or neutral.Controls take a bit of practise to get used to. The right cup is touch sensitive - a tap will play/pause/answer whereas a horizontal swipe back or forth with skip/back track. Volume is controlled by a circular motion - clockwise to increase and anti clockwise to decrease. It’s the volume that takes the most practise but if I’m honest it’s really tricky to pull off. Sometimes it’s hyper sensitive, other times seems to ignore you.To be fair - touch controls with virtually every headphone are hit and miss, some are better than others and these are fine in the grand scheme of things.The hard shell case is really nice too, and there is a hidden compartment for the 3.5mm aux cable and USB C charging cable. 30 hours battery with ANC on? That’s about right - from a full charge I got just over 31 hours at 60% volume.If you want premium headphones that sound great, have good ANC and are exceptionally comfortable these will do it, so long as your not wanting to use them for exercise or outside in the wind.If you want a pair for exercising, or out and about these won’t be for you.

Bang & Olufsen es una marca de referencia en el mercado audiovisual. Tengo varios productos y su calidad en el sonido es impresionante.En este caso, son unos auriculares bluetooth increíbles, no solo por su calidad sino también por la comodidad de llevarlos puestos, gracias a su diadema y almohadillas.Además, destaco de ellos lo siguiente:- Sonido Hifi de alta calidad, con espectaculares graves, medios y agudos.- Totalmente configurables con la app Bang & Olufsen.- Espectacular cancelación de ruido, tanto por la almohadilla que tapa muy bien las orejas como pon la cancelación de ruido activa que anula todos los ruidos exteriores.- Duración de la batería de 30 horas, algo menor cuando usas la cancelación de ruido.- Conexión ultra rápida con tu dispositivo una vez ya han sido emparejados.- Son súper cómodos. La calidad de acabado hace que al ponértelos todo sea suavidad, además de ser ligeros.- Incluye una funda, un cable de audio micro Jack 3,5mm y otro cable de carga tipo Ubs-C.En resumen. Es tan grande su calidad de sonido que la única de explicar como suenan es probarlos.Si buscas unos auriculares de gran calidad, no lo dudes.

Commençons par les points positifs, l'emballage du casque est très beau, la sacoche très solide et le casque en lui même respire la qualité.Puis, on installe l'application Bang & Olufsen. Ca prend un certain temps, ce n'est pas fluide, il faut s'enregistrer, mais  il y a des confusions avec le compte google, déjà, ça m'ennuie profondément que ça ne soit pas fluide.Bon, l'appairage bluetooth se fait plus facilement qu'avec l'appli, c'est déjà ça. Et après le son. Il est très bon, bien dans le détail, c'est vrai que c'est très plaisant... mais de là à y mettre ce prix, je ne suis pas sûr. Déjà parce que ce casque est prévu pour les smartphones. Il est bluetooth et le jack qui est fourni ne permet pas de le brancher sur une chaîne hifi. Alors bon, quand bien même on aurait des fichiers FLACS ou WAVES sur son smartphone, il ne s'agira jamais de la meilleur source sonore. Du coup, est-ce que ça vaut le coup d'investir autant, quand des intra auriculaires font un boulot presque équivalent pour deux fois moins cher ? D'autant que je trouve que l'écoute est fatigante au bout d'un certain moment.Alors oui, il y a le prestige de la marque, ça en jette. Mais à part ça, je reste perpexe. Pourquoi n'avoir pas fourni un jack long 6.35 ? Cela fait un peu pingre !Bref, pour les inconditionnels de la marque...

I've never used B&O headphones before but my dad's car has some of their speakers and they are excellent from what he says, my expectations for these headphones were very high and I would say they only just met them.Let's start off with the build quality, they are extremely well made, there is a single bit of plastic to be seen on the outside, it is all aluminium, leather, and fabric, they clearly did not cheap out on the materials with these headphones, very impressed.So how comfortable are they?...Very!I couldn't name you any wireless headphones more comfortable than these, I can wear them for hours without feeling any pain on my ears, I am a little annoyed there's no markings to indicate how open the headphones are when you pull them out of the headband, although this is standard at this point.The earcups are foam inside and leather on the outside, I'm not usually a fan of leather earcups but these weren't bad at all, my ears usually get very sweaty in leather earcups and they still did in these, but noticably less compared to headsets like the Jabra Evolve2 85.A common issue with headphones is how tight they grip onto your head, I've used headphones with a similar-ish design to these and the main issue with the comfort was how tight they were, thankfully with these ones properly adjusted they feel absolutely perfect, not too much or too little pressure, just perfect to keep them on your head without causing pain.Before we get onto sound quality, I want to talk a bit about the touch panel on the right earcup.If you don't know, the right earcup is touch responsive and will react to gestures, allowing you to pause your music (tap), raise the volume (slide your finger in a circle clockwise) turn it down (slide your finger in a circle anti-clockwise), skip to the next song (swipe forwards)... you get what I mean, I hated this at first but it's really grew on me over the past few weeks I've been using these headphones and I don't think I want to go back to physical buttons anymore, just be very careful not to accidentally raise your volume while trying to lower it like I did.So how is the sound?Honestly... It didn't live up to my expectations, sound is very subjective so don't decide whether or not to buy these just from this paragraph, try them yourself if possible.The sound isn't really bad, it's just so average for such an expensive set of headphones, it's definitely better than cheaper options like the 85h in my opinion but not enough to make it worth twice the price, if you're looking for bass you won't get it here, if you're looking for soundstage you won't get it here, if you're looking for realism you won't get it here, the sound is just so hard to describe, it does everything yet also does nothing, don't get me wrong, I like the sound, but it's just so... boring.If you've got the kind of money to buy headphones like these without hesitation, I probably couldn't recommend you a better option that offers everything these do, they really are nice but just fall short in one of the most important parts to me, they are most definitely worth a go and if you like the sound, I am genuinely happy for you, one sound signature can't work for everyone after all.That's about it, thanks for reading my review!

Die Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX sind erstaunlich gut. In einer flachen Transportschale befinden sich die optisch schicken und erstaunlich leichten Kopfhörer. Das geringe Gewicht hat mich erstaunt und positiv überrascht. Der Tragekomfort ist dadurch und durch die angenehm weichen Ohrmuscheln super.Das Verbinden via Bluetooth geht problemlos und die Verbindung ist stabil. Die Akkulaufzeit ist mehr als ausreichend und beim Klang... nun, ich bin hier ein Fachmann und habe kein absolutes Gehör, dass der Sound aber spitze ist, das kann ich sagen. Der Klang ist klar, der Bass super ohne übertrieben zu sein und ich frage mich, wie B&O das bei diesem Gewicht schafft. Auch das ANC funktioniert super, tiefe Töne verschwinden fast vollständig und bei den Höhen reicht schon leise Musik um auch diese auszublenden.Für rund 500 Euro definitiv kein Schnäppchen aber gut angelegtes Geld wenn man hochwertigen Klanggenuss mag und ich bin sicher, man hat an diesen Kopfhörern viele Jahre seine Freude.Fazit: Teuer aber hoher Tragekomfort und toller Klang.

Premetto che si, mi piace molto ascoltare musica, si sono attento al dettaglio e alla qualità dei suoni, ma non sono un audiofilo e  le mie valutazioni di ascolto sono piuttosto soggettive e dipendono molto dai miei gusti in fatto di generi musicali.Prediligo il folk, il pop rock degli anni 70, e come contemporanei amo solo pochi autori come Chris Pureka o Glen Hansard, ho quindi, mi rendo conto, ho vedute un po' ristrette in questo settore.Anni fa ho trovato nelle Sennheiser Momentum 2 una cuffia che mi ha pienamente soddisfatto e fatto amare e riascoltare sotto una nuova luce album che avevo sentito mille volte, ma ascoltandoli di nuovo con le Sennheiser, la sensazione è di averli ascoltati per la prima volta.E allora ho voluto provare queste nuove Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX, confrontandole con il mio metro di paragone le  Sennheiser Momentum 2.*** COME SUONANOEccoci al momento del primo ascolto, collego sia le mie Sennheiser che le Beoplay al mio amplificatore NAS 320 e inserisco i primi CD nel lettore...La prima impressione di ascolto per le Beoplay è .. nitidezza, .. precisione,... dettaglio...e facendo confronti al volo con le mie Sennheiser, il suono che mi aveva tanto ammaliato e colpito fino ad ora, adesso mi sembrava più “sporco”, notavo nelle Sennheiser una presenza quasi continua delle frequenze basse. Primo round quindi di pancia subito per le nuove Beoplay.Ma questa era la solo la mia prima impressione di ascolto... proseguendo poi con i confronti, ascoltando altri brani, passando del tempo a prendere confidenza con le differenze di sonorità,  quello che inizialmente mi aveva stupito come nitidezza e precisione di riproduzione della Beoplay ha cominciato a vacillare,...è emersa invece come qualità delle Sennheiser quel presentare una forse minore precisione e una presenza forse eccessiva dei toni bassi, non come volume, ma proprio come una presenza di fondo che non ti abbandona mai, è come se tra una nota di basso e l'altra non ci fossero spazi vuoti ma quasi un “continuum” di frequenza basse..E quindi dopo qualche tempo di ascolto ho ribaltato inaspettatamente le mie impressioni, l'eccessiva precisione delle Beoplay risultava per me (attenzione che potrebbe essere questa una valutazione soggettiva) più “stancante” alla lunga.La morbidezza delle Sennheiser è vero che “impasta” leggermente ma è una morbidezza nella quale i suoni risultano più un corpo unico (pur mantenendo la scena ampia), il colpo di rullante secco preciso, quasi una frustata delle Beoplay alla lunga mi affatica, la sensazione con le Sennheiser è di indossare un caldo e morbido maglione dello scorso anno, forse un po' sformato ma molto molto comodo e forse preferibile all'abito giacca e cravatta impeccabile delle Beoplay.Qui va forse detto che può influire molto, e anche qui si evidenziano i miei limiti, il tipo di musica che si ascolta.Per ora le mie impressioni sono state dettate dai miei grandi classici, album dei Dire Straits, con il mio brano test “Private Investigation” su tutti, album dei Pink Floyd, Clapton, suonate piano e voce, ballate Country Rock, ecc.E allora è stato necessario, anche se non sono generi che prediligo, ascoltare generi come il jazz o la musica elettronica , per una completezza di valutazione.Ed ecco un nuovo ribaltamento di fronte: effettivamente ascoltando jazz la precisione maggiore delle Beoplay diventa importante, il dettaglio anche eccessivo mi pare sia ora indispensabile,  soprattutto se mi rimetto le Sennheiser e noto come sia forse fuori luogo il suono eccessivamente caldo che producono.Che dire quindi come giudizio finale? Forse che una sentenza non si può scrivere, non la potete avere da me, comunque.Mi pare di aver capito che l'utilizzo di Beoplay o Sennheiser è fortemente dipendente dal tipo di musica e di atmosfera che si cerca o preferisce.Non ha senso ascoltare “If” dei Pink Floyd con le Beoplay come viceversa non lo ha ascoltare tecno, o jazz con le mie  Sennheiser.Siamo comunque di fronte a due grandi prodotti, e la mia continua incertezza nello sceglie l'una o l'altra come migliore non fa che confermare questo aspetto a mio parere.*** FUNZIONALITA'Qui è già un terreno più facile su cui muoversi.Rispetto alle mie Sennheiser le Beoplay sono su un altro pianeta: mentre sulle Sennheiser per il volume c'è una levetta meccanica, e per il salto brano bisogna affidarsi alla nostra abilità di premere il numero di volte giusto un pulsantino (altrimenti ti parte una chiamata telefonica), qui è tutto molto facile e intuitivo.Tutto è localizzato sul padiglione destro:un tap esegue il play/stop del branouno swipe (avanti o indietro parallelamente al terreno) esegue il next /previous del branouno swipe circolare esegue l'aumento o la diminuzione del volumeIl tutto sia che le cuffie siano in modalità wireless che collegate via cavo. Perfezione , naturalezza dei gesti e comodità assoluta.La App delle Beoplay è fatta in maniera molto funzionale.La parte più importante è la sezione di equalizzazione, dove non è presente il classico grafico delle frequenze, ma una specie di joypad visto dall'alto dove alla posizione centrale corrisponde il settaggio neutro, spostandosi verso l'alto e allontanandosi dal centro, si enfatizzano di più le frequenze alte o quella basse.E' possibile avere dei preset e anche ovviamente salvare il proprio personalizzato che viene memorizzato nelle cuffie anche ad App spenta.Non è possibile creare curve personalizzate tagliando o enfatizzando zone delle frequenze. Personalmente non amo molto questa soluzione, ma anche qui è certamente una mia valutazione soggettiva.*** INDOSSABILITA' ED ESTETICALe cuffie sono molto leggere (pesano esattamente 290 gr.) e calzano in modo perfetto senza affaticare anche dopo ore di ascolto.La pelle dei pad è eccezionalmente morbida.L'estetica è molto minimale, i pulsanti comodi e facili da raggiungere anche a cuffie indossate.*** LA CANCELLAZIONE DEL RUMOREQuesta parte non è al momento in cui scrivo ben documentata,comunque nella App sono disponibili le opzioni:1) ANC Adattivo .Dal sito Beoplay leggo: Cancellazione del rumore adattiva utilizza microfoni e altoparlanti per adattarsi automaticamente all'ambiente circostante. Questo è il tipo di ANC più sofisticato, in cui il livello di cancellazione del rumore si adatta digitalmente all'ambiente circostante. 2) Quantitàdi ANC: qui si regola manualmente tirando lo slider a sx si aumenta la quantitàdi taglio del rumore, mentre a dx la si diminuisce.Sul padiglione sx delle cuffie è presente un pulsante (quello lungo e stretto) che se premuto alternativamente fornisce la funzione di:Trasparenza: consente di ascoltare direttamente il mondo circostante senza disattivare la musica o toglierti gli auricolari dalle orecchie.Neutro: una posizione intermedia tra cancellazione del rumore massima e minimaCancellazione massima La cancellazione del rumore è molto efficace, l'ho provata in stanze molto rumorose con sottofondo di ventole e pc in funzione e il taglio è pressochè totale.*** CONSIDERAZIONI FINALILe Beoplay sono certamente un grande prodotto, con un'estetica ed una cura dei materiali e dei dettagli molto elevata.La qualità del suono non può deludere, ma va forse posta un po' di attenzione al genere musicale verso il quale ci si vuole rivolgere.La sezione di equalizzazione nella App va forse ampliata e migliorata per renderla più precisa e controllabile in modo da far rendere al meglio le Beoplay in ogni condizione di ascolto.In dotazione viene fornita anche una comoda e molto ben fatta custodia rigida per il trasporto delle cuffie e dei cavi di collegamento e di ricarica.Infine una valutazione sul prezzo di vendita (499€ al 3/2021) che è a mio parere leggermente eccessivo, ma come spesso avviene in questo settore , si paga anche il marchio e la qualità a questo connessa.Spero di essere stato utile a chi si sta orientando all'acquisto di questo prodotto, che in ogni caso non vi deluderà.

Si pudiera explicar con dos palabras lo que estos auriculares nos ofrecen simplemente sería: COMODIDAD y CALIDADSuelo usar unos Bose 700 y en algunos momentos se pueden hacer incómodos porque ""aprietan"" un poco para que se mantengan fijos debido a su especial estructura, pero estos Beoplay son brutales: No aprietan pero se ajustan perfectamente al contorno de tu cabeza sin apretar en las orejas.Respecto a la calidad de sonido puedo asegurar, después de que hayan pasado más de 100 auriculares por mis oídos, que la calidad de sonido supera a los Bose 700 y a la serie4 de Sony, sin duda, aunque me quedo con la reducción de ruido de los Bose700.En cuanto a autonomía de batería llega al nivel de los Sony sin ninguna duda.Para el que se quiera gastarse o tenga 500 eur ahorrados para unos auriculares... Estos son los suyos

To spend £450 on headphones, you're going to be either an industry professional or audiophile looking for the very best. And with the Apple AirPods Max at just £100 more, Bang & Olufsen have not only high expectations of their customers to contend with, but inevitable comparisons to Apple too.The first thing I noticed upon opening the box is that these are large headphones. They're clearly made to cover your entire ears and surround you with sound. Indeed, the impressive active-noise cancellation - that actively tracks, measures and covers-up background noise - combined with the large ear cups means that when you close your eyes you're truly immersed in the music. You can hear absolutely nothing except what is being played.Adding to this, the headphones are incredibly light and comfortable. Although the headphones have a big, bulky look to them, immediately upon picking them up they feel light and the squidgy ear cups are incredibly comfortable for as long as you wear them. The result is that you forget you're wearing headphones, which only takes the immersion a step further.Style-wise, I think the headphones look sleek. I personally am not a fan of wearing headphones out in town or on a commute. I also think that this would be potentially risky with such expensive headphones, however in a social setting, coffee shop, work environment, or just at home they look good. I went with the black ones, which seem to resist dirt and scratches well too.The sound quality is superb, as you'd hope! Everything sounds authentic - music is punchy and incredibly clear. I tested a load of music and podcasts and movies to make sure all ranges were where'd I like them to be and I couldn't find anything I can complain about. I can honestly say these are the best sounding headphones I have used, even before I began playing with settings in the app. Moving on to the app, I think this app would be one of my slight frustrations with these headphones. There's an amazing array of customisation options and the ability to tailor your listening experience to your exact preferences, but you do have to login to the app and spend time setting up your profile and product, which is a bit time consuming and annoying. I'd much rather the app didn't require me to create an account. It's a small complaint, but one I feel I need to mention.The headphones do have a built in mic that is 'good'. I wouldn't say it is 'studio' quality or anywhere near it, but it's impressive for a mic that's buried in the headphones somewhere. I'm reluctant to reduce scoring for a not-so-outstanding mic, as I think the mic is there for convenience so you can take a phone call if one comes in when you're using them or maybe have a quick zoom chat. It's not being marketed as a mic to record podcasts or vocals and I don't know of any headphones near this price range that offer this.Battery life is phenomenal. With a 3 hour charge you're getting upwards of 35 hours playtime. Even when the battery runs out you can use the headphones either via USB or the included lead with a 3.5mm jack to continue listening to music until you can charge them. These cables have their own storage space in the included fabric case, which itself is just big enough to keep everything in. It looks great and suits the minimalistic style of the headphones well.Look, at £450 these headphones aren't going to be within everyone's budget. However, if you are in the industry or are really into your music and want to spoil yourself then I think these headphones are probably the most comfortable, best sounding headphones you could buy. Not for a moment whilst wearing these could I think of anyway I'd change them. They'll be my go to for quite some time.

These are premium wireless headphones; they are over-ear but relatively compact and lightweight (285g). They are an upgrade of the previous model, Beoplay H9, with longer battery life (35 hours), upgraded ANC (Active Noise Cancellation), and four microphones in place of two. It is not top of the B&O range; for that you need to spend quite a bit more for the H95. Gamers are directed to the similarly-priced Portal model which has a few more features (Dolby Atmos, Xbox Wireless) but shorter battery life and no case; worth considering as it probably sounds equally good but I do not have a Portal to compare.What you are paying for with the HX is a beautiful minimalist design and excellent sound quality. The sound is clean, sweet and exceptionally clear, perfect for extended listening sessions. Trying these out is a matter of “I just want to hear how they sound on [insert another favourite track]”; they convey every detail and are superbly tuneful. It is almost easier to describe what they don’t do: the bass is not distorted or exaggerated, notes are not smeared, they are never harsh. Listening to an old favourite like Kind of Blue by Miles Davis you can follow the bass lines easily, hear every nuance of the percussion. Applause on Alison Krauss and the Union Station live sounds like it does at a concert, many hands clapping. Listening to Richard Thompson’s guitar work on Acoustic Classics you get a sense of the texture of the strings plus amazing realism from the vocals. The drama on the opening bars of Beethoven’s 9th symphony, performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Leonard Bernstein, is wonderfully communicated.In other words, if you are a hi-fi enthusiast, the HX will remind you of why. I could also easily hear the difference between the same tracks on Spotify, and CD or high-res tracks on my Sony player. AptX HD is supported.That said, there are unfortunately a few annoyances; not deal-breakers but they must be mentioned. First, the HX has touch controls for play/pause, volume, and skip track. I dislike touch controls because you get no tactile feedback and it is easy to trigger accidentally. With the HX you play/pause by tapping the right earcup; it’s not pleasant even when it works because you get a thump sound in your ear, and half the time you don’t hit it quite right, or you think you haven’t, tap again, then realise you did and have now tapped twice. Swipe for skip track works better, but volume is not so good, you have to use a circular motion and it is curiously difficult to get a small change; nothing seems to happen, then it jumps up or down. Or you trigger skip track by mistake. Ugh.Luckily there are some real buttons on the HX. These cover on/off, and ANC control, which toggles between on, transparent (hear external sounds) and inactive. There is also a multi-button which activates voice assistants if you use these.Second, there is an app. I tried it on an iPad. Major annoyance here is that it does not work at all unless you create an account with B&O and sign in. Why should you have to sign in to use your headphones? What are the privacy implications? That aside, I had a few issues getting the app to find the HX, but once I succeeded there are a few extra features. In particular, you can set listening modes which are really custom EQ, or create your own EQ using an unusual graphic controller that sets a balance between Bright, Energetic, Warm and Relaxed. You can also update firmware, set wear detection on or off (pauses play when headphones are removed). Finally, and perhaps most important, you can tune the ANC, though changes don’t seem to persist if you then operate the button. You can also enable Adaptive ANC which is meant to adjust the level of ANC automatically according to the surroundings. It didn’t seem to me to make much difference but maybe it does if you are moving about.The ANC is pretty good though. I have a simple test; I work in a room with a constant hum from servers and ANC should cut out this noise. It does. Further, engaging ANC doesn’t change the sound much, other than cutting out noise, which is how it should work.There is a 3.5mm jack connection for wired use, but with two important limitations. First, this does not work at all if the battery is flat; the headphones must be turned on. Second, the jack connection lacks the extra connection that enables use for calling, so for listening only. The sound quality was no better wired, perhaps slightly worse, so of limited value.Despite a few annoyances I really like these headphones. I doubt I will use the app, other than for firmware updates, and rarely bother with the touch controls, which means I can enjoy the lovely sound, elegant design, good noise cancelling, and comfortable wear.

Here is my review of the B & O Beoplay HX ( H10 )Mine is the Black Anthracite variant as the other colours were not available at launch when this review was written.The main selling features of these portable headphones are the adaptive active noise cancellation and the transparency but I will talk about that further below.Accessories - They come with a very nice, well made and sturdy case which also holds the USB A to Type C charge cable and the 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable which are both 1.25m in length. Also has some documentation which consists of basic user guide and safety information.Battery - They last around 40hrs with Bluetooth only and around 35hrs max with the active noise cancelling on take around 2 hours to charge but bear in mind this battery life depends on your listening volume.Build and functionality - The build and design is one of the best I have seen but the type of ear pads they use means it can get warm around the ears which is one of the negatives of this. On the left ear cup there is the ANC/Transparency button but it does not say a prompt of which mode you have selected which should be addressed as it is not always obvious of the selected mode, two microphones and the multi function button and I am not sure if this button can be programmed for other uses. On the right ear cup is the 3.5mm input but can only be used when the headphones is powered on which is a negative but at least it is not a proprietary connection, type c input for charging with a status led if it is charging or full charged and the power/pair button with a status led and two microphones as well. The touch controls are intuitive and you get used to them pretty quickly if you are listening to music or on a call.Comfort - I found these very comfortable but like I wrote above they can get warm around the ears. I have a smaller head so the clamp on these was just enough but if you have larger you will be fine and they have plenty of height adjustment. They are also light weight at 285g so I had no issues with the weight of these. The headphones can also be laid flat like in my pictures so you can rest them around your neck and L and R are clearly labeled so you know which way round they are worn.B & O app - These are compatible with the app and it offers basic functionality like it can do firmware updates, a basic equaliser with presets, control volume and play/pause and control the strength of the active noise cancelling and transparency mode. Two things I don't like are you have to create an account and have to have location services enabled. There is also a function with adjustable strength if you take the headphones off it will automatically pause the track and when you put them back on it will continue the song for example.ANC and transparency - These both work to a very high standard but a negative is that when the button is pressed to change the modes it should prompt which mode you selected so if you are in a quiet room it will be hard to tell which one is in use. The active noise cancelling is adaptive so adjusts itself to the situation you are in.Bluetooth - They use AAC/SBC and Adaptive AptX with Bluetooth 5.1 and is what I used with my phone which is a Poco F2 Pro. Signal strength and connectivity was perfect, supports multipoint so can be connected to your phone and laptop at the same time and supports all the fast pairing certifications for really easy pairing.Sound - I found these to have a pretty neutral sound signature which is meant to be the B&O house sound and makes a change from all the V shaped sound signatures out there. I found everything very clear with no harshness and represented the sound how the music artists want you to. Hard to fault the sound to be honest. Microphone quality was also very clear.Overall these are very good but the price is a bit off putting but the fit, finish and engineering that went into I am not surprised. The ear cups are even detachable if you need to replace them.Cons of these headphones are price, no voice prompt when changing ANC/Transparency modes, 3.5mm only works when they are turned on, your head can get warm where the ear pads touch your head, app is a bit intrusive with log in required and location services required.Overview is these are very good portable on the go headphones if you are okay with the cons I mentioned above.

I got these earbuds to wear at the gym and at work and they seem to be working out well for both. They do cancel a good bit of noise, but when it is quiet in my office and they are turned down, I can still hear people around me unless I turn them up, which is good for me because I have to be aware of my surrounding. I have not had any issues with battery life and they seem to be working out well. Overall, I love these.

My AirPods 2nd gen stopped holding much of a charge after two years, and I didn't really feel like spending over $100 again to replace them. Saw these on sale and gave them a shot, and they are just as good. I prefer earbuds that do not have the tips on them, which seem to be harder to find. I do miss the battery level pop ups on iOS, and I found out you have to go into the accessibility options on an iPhone to route calls to Bluetooth. But battery life has been great, and they sound just as good as the AirPods 2 I had before, and the light on the case does make it easy to tell when it's done charging. Build quality is about as good too.

They are light weight and stable in my ears. There are no covers needed and so they don't become useless when the covers disappear. Most are heavy, and hurt my ears. These are great for walking and listening to my favorite comedy channel when I walk.Amazing!

Day 1 (Will update if there's any changes)So I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to sound quality. I've sent back many headphone including Bose Quietcomforts, and Seinheisser 450's for poor sound quality vs price paid. I wasn't expecting much from these Airpod knockoffs for $20 but when I got them, the first thing I noticed was the feel. They don't feel like $20 headphones, in fact I would go so far as to say they have a better quality feel than actual Airpods. The plastics are heavy and solid feeling, the spring hinge feels robust, and the charging port doesn't feel like one of those cheap-o ones you find on Chinese junk electronics. There is a satisfying clunk when you slot the earpieces into place for charging and the controls are pretty easy and responsive. If I had to nitpick something negative to say it'd be that the earpieces aren't the easiest to get out of the case, but that could just be my big o'fat fingers.On to the sound quality. HOLY CRAP. I'm genuinely shook by the quality of the sound that comes out of these headphones. I have a pair of August EP650's that have been my go to headphones for years now, I love them so much I bought a second pair, and the 750's when they came out but went back to the 650's (long story) so when I say that I'm thinking of replacing my 650's with these I want you to understand my full meaning. I LOVE my 650's. If these earbuds can last the test of time, they might have just dethroned my King.The earpieces fit my ears very well, don't jiggle or slip, they don't pinch or feel like they're trying to take my ears virtues in anyway. I've worn them for a few days at this point and they are quickly endearing themselves to me. The volume gets really loud too, like way louder than I'll probably ever need. And at max volume I did notice a little bit of buzzing and sound distortion, but that's to be expected from asking so much of small drivers. Normally I listen to them at about 40% volume and that's been more than plenty for me.

I love these earbuds! They are nice and compact, sound is excellent. Like many other ones you can turn the volume up or down just by lightly touching the earbuds, you can pause videos with these as well. The quality is really good, price is good. I love these things.

I got these earbuds to wear at the gym and at work and they seem to be working out well for both. They do cancel a good bit of noise, but when it is quiet in my office and they are turned down, I can still hear people around me unless I turn them up, which is good for me because I have to be aware of my surrounding. I have not had any issues with battery life and they seem to be working out well. Overall, I love these.

My AirPods 2nd gen stopped holding much of a charge after two years, and I didn't really feel like spending over $100 again to replace them. Saw these on sale and gave them a shot, and they are just as good. I prefer earbuds that do not have the tips on them, which seem to be harder to find. I do miss the battery level pop ups on iOS, and I found out you have to go into the accessibility options on an iPhone to route calls to Bluetooth. But battery life has been great, and they sound just as good as the AirPods 2 I had before, and the light on the case does make it easy to tell when it's done charging. Build quality is about as good too.
"

They are light weight and stable in my ears. There are no covers needed and so they don't become useless when the covers disappear. Most are heavy, and hurt my ears. These are great for walking and listening to my favorite comedy channel when I walk.Amazing!

Day 1 (Will update if there's any changes)So I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to sound quality. I've sent back many headphone including Bose Quietcomforts, and Seinheisser 450's for poor sound quality vs price paid. I wasn't expecting much from these Airpod knockoffs for $20 but when I got them, the first thing I noticed was the feel. They don't feel like $20 headphones, in fact I would go so far as to say they have a better quality feel than actual Airpods. The plastics are heavy and solid feeling, the spring hinge feels robust, and the charging port doesn't feel like one of those cheap-o ones you find on Chinese junk electronics. There is a satisfying clunk when you slot the earpieces into place for charging and the controls are pretty easy and responsive.

This is a great pair of ear buds for the price. I've owned a lot of ear buds but this is the first pair I have chosen to review. Why? Simply they are the best I've bought.

These pink headphones are cute and get the job done.

Sound can be a little too explosive like 90% is rather normal then 100% just explodes your ear drum so not too levelled, other than that they haven't died on me yet and once you get used to the tap features super manageable I'd recommend them most because of the price.

These earbuds are cute, comfy, and I haven't drained the batteries yet in normal daily use (intermittent over a work day). They function in a bare-minimum way. But the sound quality is really disappointing. There's no bass to speak of, and higher tones are weak. The sound overall is both tinny and muffled. OH, and the touch controls on the earbuds themselves are miserable. I can't adjust their placement without changing the volume or skipping around the media. I would not buy these again.

The Instruction Manual includes a link to sign up for an extended (total two-year warranty). The S22 earbuds do not come with any additional fit tips/comfort tips because they don’t need anything to stay in for all-day comfort. Highly recommend.

The title of the product says ""deep bass"", but in reality the spectrum falls off pretty steeply at the low end. Bass is almost non-existent with these. They do stay in your ears, but since they don't seal (they're all plastic with no rubber liners), all you get is a shriek-like sound from them; all high-end and some mid-range frequencies. Some songs I actually had trouble identifying because there was no low-end sounds coming through.

If you're expecting a $200 bluetooth earbud for this price, you are going to be sorely disappointing.When my phone is in my pocket, the Bluetooth will sometimes disconnect,  and reconnect, interrupting music. Just adjusting them to sit in your ear, and you'll shut them off or switch songs.The audio is sub par, and leaves a lot to be desired.Nice for a kid thats going to probably just lose them anyway.

These headphones doesn’t come with paring mode option! If you need to switch from one device to another, you’ll have to delete from one device and then connect to another. Unlike other headphones I own I can put the headphones paring mode while connected to my iPhone and re-pair with my iPad if I choose too and can reverse the process as many times as I want. This option is very important when you have multiple devices in your household!!

How do you keep them from falling out of your ears I took a 20 minute walk and 5 times one fell out ofvmy ear Finally  the only way I could keep them in was to stick the antenna into parts of my ear and lodge it in  which is not easy to do they do not stick enough into the ear to stay non place so I plan to replace with wireless headphones  I am not pleased withnthe product

 Hi! This was great in the beginning( I probably don’t even have a month with it); now one doesn’t want to fully charge or connect to my phone the other one stays connect to my phone even after I put it back in their case so by the time I want to use them they are low on batteries… what a disappointment! Now I have to travel without headphones.
"

Sound is great. Pairing is horrible, most times doesn’t  pair right away like described. They fall out of my ears constantly. When a call comes in and my phone is not right in front of me I have no idea who’s calling-def do not like that. I’m missing calls. Background noise is still there just like in every earbud I’ve owned. Very unhappy. You get what you pay for. These earbuds are junk in my opinion. For $22 what do you expect though.

So I've been trying these out for over a month now and I like these! I've been alternating between this set and others in search of Earbuds to replace my favorites that eventually just stopped working. Sound and battery life are most important, for me anyway. With that said, Sound is pretty good. These don't sound awful but for $22, I was hoping they would sound a bit better than they do BUT! They are the best I've tried so far and over the last three months I've tried 4 pairs since my last set stopped working. Though they are very easy to charge right in the case, Battery life NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. That is the one issue I'm constantly having with these. They absolutely do NOT last 30+hrs as advertised before needing to be charged. Perhaps I received a set that nobody in QC noticed wasn't up to par in that category but whatever the reason, for me that's the most frustrating thing. The most time I get out of these before they need charging is about 17.5hrs. They are comfortable when wearing for long periods of time and I had zero trouble connecting them to my devices. And! They're PINK! Yea, I love pink. I'm probably considered too old to like it as much as I do at my age but, it is what it is. Seriously though, a decent sounding set of Earbuds that need MUCH work on battery life.
"
3892,"
I do like these ear buds. They connect quickly, and you don't have to use both at the same time. They will pair with your device independently of the other.  I like the small case, and the pink color of the set.  I don't like that these ear buds are missing the rubber piece that fits the bud in your ear.  These earbuds do slip around a little bit.Battery life is typical. I can listen to my phone with these all day, and a full charge will last the full time I am at work. I charge at night, and use these all day.
"
3893,"
The sound on these is really good. The microphone is a little inconsistent. Sometimes it’s great, sometimes it sounds like I’m under water. The battery life is pretty long. I probably charge once a week or so. They also feel really nice in the ear.
"
3894,"
I've always wanted small bluetooth headphones and these are my first ever pair and i'm obsessed with them! they work very well, light to carry around, and are super cute. I got so many compliments while wearing them and i'm so happy with this product. I wear them to the gym which is perfect while doing different workouts and running around.
"
3895,"
These are overall good earbuds but the sound goes from a 5 to a 10 without warning. The shipping took forever which I'm sure if that was the manufacture or amazon's fault. They have a good fit and the sound is clear just don't turn them up too quickly!
"
3896,"
These are simple great headphones and they work great. I think they're better than the airpods that I had. Much cheaper as well. Only con for me would be the headphones need better noise cancellation.
"
3897,"
I recently purchased these to wear at night so I can listen to music as I fall asleep and not disturb my wife. I have listened to them for over a week now and haven’t had to recharge them yet. They also sound really good. These are just as good as my wife’s earbuds she paid nearly $300 for. I am not exaggerating they are that good. I was worried they wouldn’t sound good but they sound great. For the price there’s no way you can go wrong with these headphones. Plus if you lose one you’re not out a couple hundred bucks. I am extremely pleased with these headphones.
"
3898,"
Out of the millions of earbuds I've tried recently, these are my favorite so far. I switched from Apple to Android and my Airpods no longer worked as smoothly with my phone, so I've been looking for new ones. The Samsung buds work great, but fit horribly, so I've been looking for buds that fit like Airpods, yet don't sound like crap.These are pretty close. They fit comfortably and are easy to control. I love the easy one-tap volume control as I need to change the volume a lot when I'm doing yard work. Double-tap pause works well, and the sound is clean and clear. They're a little tinny sounding when compared to Samsung or Airpods, but these are much cheaper, so that's to be expected.My only issue with these is sometimes when I put them in, the volume is uneven. The right bud will sound normal, but the left bud is barely making any sound or vice versa. I have to take them out, put them back in the case, close it, then put them back in my ears. That always fixes the problem, but it's worth noting that it happens about 50% of the time I put them in my ears, even when they're fully charged.Overall, though, these tiny little buds get the job done, and they're the easiest to use out of all I've tried. I should mention, though, that the assistant ('Hey Google') only works if your phone is on you and can pick up the command. If your phone is in another room and you triple-tap for 'Hey Google', it will not activate because your phone needs to hear it, not the speakers.

My daughter LOVES these headphones.She is allowed to use them in school, so takes them daily, and uses them when allowed.I knew she liked them, but when she came to the garage and plug them in today, I asked her how often she has to charge them. She said about once per month.She doesn’t often use them at night, only during school. But the fact that she doesn’t have to worry about battery life is nice.She also loves the pink!

I got these so I didn't have to keep switching my earbuds from my personal computer to my work computer... Now I have these white ones for work and a black pair for personal (not this brand). They were super easy to connect, hold a charge well, and are comfortable in my ear.Only complaint is that it's very easy to accidentally turn the volume to max when I put them in my ear. But, I can turn the volume down on the actual earbud, I have to do that on the computer. No matter what I do, it only goes up... At least the little voice tells me ""Maximum Volume"" so I know to fix it before I start my calls or play any sound.

 I am very impressed by the sound quality! Instant connection, great bass and volume control. I have had a couple disconnection issues, and had to place the ear buds back into the case, take them back out (which is also a small issue) and re-pair them. There isn't a groove/dip on the case to help get them out--especially if you have nails. You have to grip each one a certain way and then pull up. The batter life though is amazing. They are comfortable to wear throughout the day as well.
"
3902,"
These are decent, comfortable earbuds. They do a good job for voice (calls/podcasts) but they lack of decent base makes them a bit tinny for music.They are comfortable to wear and the battery lasts at least 2 hours in my experience.I like that the touch control require more than one tap so as to avoid accidental commands when just touching them to put in/take out or just adjust in the ear.

✅ distinct mids🔻 ~zero passive noise reductionFor the price, $22 at time of order, these will please most people on a tight budget.These are the type to balanced hang in your ear so there is almost zero fitment passive noise cancellation.For ANC the best bang for your buck is 2.25 times the cost:

They are four stars for what they claim they are.  Where Mifo S is 5 stars this is 2 stars. If you are an audiophile expecting quality sound or seeking imaging information or soundstage commentary these are not for you. You want Bluetooth 5.3 (which this is not) because both devices participate in the channel mapping thereby encouraging better performance. Your phone does not need to be 5.3. Typically I don’t like earbuds with external legs. These have leds and bulb hangers that I dislike. My dislike of these two aspects had no bearing on my rating as this was known prior to ordering.
"
3904,"
These earbuds paired so easily-- open the earbud case(they were already charged), turn on the Bluetooth on your phone. The phone recognized the earbuds right away and paired to the phone. The volume controls take a little practice to use, but so worth it because the sound is great! I wish the case had a carabiner or a key ring so I could attach it for easy access, but not a deal breaker.  I love pink so I'm happy!
"

I really like these ear buds. I had resisted ear buds because I thought they would hurt my ears but my kids use some and they talked me into trying some. The pink color is what sold me on these.These don't hurt my ears at all. They are so easy to use. The battery life is great, I hardly have to charge these.

It came packaged nicely with a charging cord and instruction pamphlet .

This is my first Amazon review ever.  I just had to do it.  I stopped buying Airpods & Raybans purely because I will inevitably misplace them somewhere.  My son broke one of my apple airpods which rendered them basically useless... I've tried 3 other cheaper (than apple) options and this is BY FAR.... BY FAR the best.  The sound quality is incredible for this price point. Also, very comfortable and aesthetically pleasing.  Buy these, thank me later.

When I buy a less than $20 bluetooth earbuds, you kinda expect what you pay for but I was surprised.Pros:-It was very easy to pair. Open it, and pair with your phone in seconds.-Battery life seems to be very long as I've used it 4 hours straight and my phone said 40% battery left-Size is very small. This can be good or bad. I am 6'0"" and it still fit snug in my ears.-It feels very comfortable in my ears-Bass was interesting but goodCons:-Touch button controls are a bit not as easy like an actual button but that was okay with me.I purchased a white one but for some reason it shows a pink one now.  I would purchase another one for sure!

Not the best sound quality for music but I love the operation!You can tap the sides of the left or right ear buds for control of volume, play/pause, answering/ hanging up callsJust have to remember which is which lolI wish it did come with rubber ear pads thoughGood for $20 dollars

These wireless earbuds are small (just a bit bigger than a quarter) and very lightweight but mighty giving the wearer clear clean tones and volume at the touch of your finger whether you’re listening to music, an audio book or just chatting on the phone. The pairing is a simple once and done. Nice range too I can be at the other end of the house before I get the disconnected prompt. Now if you’re a newbie to Bluetooth earbuds like me it may take you just a bit to use the touch controls on the buds themselves but if this is old hat you won’t have a problem figuring it out at all.

I was able to get these connected to my iPad relatively easy. I go to  use them again the next night and they wouldn’t connect. I thought maybe the battery had  already died even though I had charged it the night before. But for safe measures I charged it again. I removed the earbuds from my Bluetooth list and try to connect all over again. Was completely unsuccessful and now they are trash. The lights kept flashing from red to blue for about three seconds and then nothing. If these were quality earbuds I wouldn’t have to do any of those steps once initially connected.

Listen; I was looking for an affordable pair of earbuds when I finally found these. First of all, my need was decent call quality (cause I know for less than $80 I won’t find that greatness) but I didn’t want to spend too much money because knowing myself I easily lose these type of earbuds. When I found these, I read so many of the comments and thought: “well, maybe this company is paying people to say these great things” but still went on and tried them myself. Omg they are so beautiful, perfect pink color, AND the sound quality is so good, now when it comes to call quality, like I expected it’s not that great, but it’s decent, where the person on the other end of the call can hear me clearly, I just can’t whisper or it’ll be harder for them to hear me; but that’s ok. The only bad thing I found is they are a bit uncomfortable in my ears, BUT I found here on Amazon those foam earbuds protectors you can put on them and they help greatly.

For years I have been searching for an alternative to Apple 2nd gen Airpods (which are the only ones that fit my weird ears). and I have finally found it with this product. Shape fits just like the apple Airpods, and looks like them from a distance. Sound quality is a little worse compared to Airpods, however not drastically worse. For 1/6 the price of Apple Airpods I really cant complain

 De verdad que tienen una excelente calidad de sonido, se escuchan super fuerte, la forma es muy cómoda para el oído ya que anteriormente compre otros pero no los soportaba mucho rato me calaban, y estos son cómodos, me encanto el color mate, y  el estuche es más pequeño de lo normal lo cual se ve super bonito, el único punto malo que le pondría  es que no tiene pantalladonde diga el nivel de carga (pero al vincularlo te dice) así que de mi parte muy recomendables, buenos bonitos y baratos

 🔤Premessa: Acquistati per fare un regalo a mio nipote che ha perso i suoi, quindi si tratta dalla sua esperienza di prova.📜 Esperienza d’utilizzo: Visivamente hanno un bel design elegante ed un bel colore bianco candido. Erano già carichi all'arrivo così li ha provati immediatamente, provati durante l’allenamento in palestra, non le hanno procurato nessun fastidio ed anzi nemmeno si accorgeva di averli indossati. Li ha testati anche in auto e per certo la voce si sentiva bene, nelle chiamate la voce è ben distinta e la qualità del suono e della musica è perfetta. Per collegarli ad un device come il cellulare una volta indossati correttamente si va ad attivare il bluetooth del cellulare e tra le scelte dei dispositivi disponibili si seleziona quella corretta. Il funzionamento è semplicissimo e spiegato perfettamente all'interno del libretto di istruzioni (in italiano). Il sistema di ricarica entra in funzione quando si chiude lo sportellino, ha una micro calamita sul coperchio, alla chiusura parte la ricarica degli auricolari, poi a fine ricarica basta sollevarne uno che si attiva in automatico.  La durata della batteria è notevole e la ricarica nella custodia è rapida, in circa un ora e mezza sono nuovamente pronti all'utilizzo. La carica dura abbastanza, dipende sempre dall'uso del volume ma per me che li uso più che altro in auto o quando sono a casa vanno più che bene, anche perché la carica è abbastanza veloce. Pratici da usare, basta un tocco col dito per regolare il volume e cambiare traccia.📦 Contenuto confezione : La confezione comprende oltre agli auricolari, il cavetto di alimentazione, la custodia /ricarica,  e un libretto di istruzioni.👍 Qualità materiali/suono : Al tatto sono morbidi e sembrano molto resistenti, impermeabili e quindi possono essere utilizzati tranquillamente sotto la pioggia ed in teoria anche sotto la doccia, anche se non ho ancora sperimentato. I materiali sono molto buoni, bassi potenti e acuti molto chiari e limpidi. Quando sono inseriti correttamente, questi auricolari stupiscono per la potenza e qualità dei suoni bassi.📏 Dimensioni e peso: Le cuffiette sono leggere e di dimensioni giuste, sono discrete non sono di quelle grossolane e vistose, comode quando indossate anche per lungo tempo.💶 Prezzo : Dopo una ricerca e alcuni confronti prezzo/prestazioni, ho scelto queste cuffie wireless Bluetooth,  competitive rispetto a molte altre simili e ad un prezzo davvero inferiore rispetto a quelle più note di marca.🛃 Conclusioni:  Data la quantità del prodotto il prezzo direi sia eccellente. Consigliato senza ombra di dubbio.📬 Spedizione: Ottima la cura e l’attenzione del packaging, il tutto contenuto dentro un involucro ben solido e di qualità! Arrivato nei tempi stabiliti.

Super Bluetooth Kopfhörer. Ich habe sie zum Geburtstag verschenkt. Da wir allerdings noch nicht sicher waren, ob überhaupt welche gewünscht und dann auch genutzt werden würden, haben wir zunächst mal auf die Ausgaben für Kopfhörer eines nahmhaften Herstellers verzichtet. Sie tun aber allemal ihren Dienst, werden täglich genutzt und wurden bisher noch nicht verzweifelt.Sie sind problemlos aufzuladen und - und das ist das wichtigste! - zu verbinden! Völlig problemlos. Und einmal verbunden, bleibt die Verbindung bestehen, sodass man nicht ständig wieder bei null beginnen muss. Ein Traum.Für diesen Preis unschlagbar!

Also bei mir funktionieren die Ohrhörer einwandfrei.Mit einmal aufladen halten sie bei mir im Durchschnitt eine Woche und ich benutze sie ca.3-4 Stunden am Tag. Das Aufladen funktioniert auch super, und dauert ungefähr 2 Stunden, um auf 100% zu kommen. Die Kopfhörer sind sehr robust. Bei mir sind sie sehr oft runtergefallen und sie funktionieren immer noch perfekt. Einmal hatte ich Schwierigkeiten S-22 mit meinem Handy zu verbinden, aber nachdem ich das Handy einmal aus und dann wieder angeschaltet habe, gab es das Problem nicht mehr, kann also gut sein, dass es am Handy lag. Dass einzige was ich bei S-22 kritisieren muss ist, dass es dem Akku stand, nie richtig anzeigt, das heißt wenn ich das Gerät neu verbinde, zeigt es 100% an, obwohl es vorher nur 70% angezeigt hat. Sonst gibt es aber keine Probleme und ich kann den Kauf nur empfehlen.

Excelentes para desporto, qualidade de som razoável. Depois de já ter tido e usado outros 3 pares de earbuds de marcas e modelos diferentes, estes são os primeiros que não se desligam ao fim de algum tempo a fazer exercício (devido ao suor nos contactos). Como os contactos de carregamento são na base e não na lateral do espigão, não há contacto de àgua ou suor com os mesmos. O som não é o melhor, mas é mais que suficiente para ouvir música e até atender telefonemas quer a correr quer de bicicleta.

Non sono certo l'ideale per un ascolto di musica di qualità, ma fanno ciò che devono e la batteria sembra avere una buona durata: facendone un uso saltuario sto ancora usando la ricarica originale con cui mi sono arrivati.

Estaba contento con la compra, pero la alegría me ha durado poco y probablemente los devuelva, ya que aún estoy a tiempo:escuchando música se oyen bien, a un volumen considerable, aunque estés al 50% de lo que te permiten los auriculares. Sin embargo, es recibir una llamada de teléfono y la situación se vuelve tediosa: como haya el más mínimo ruido de fondo —en el gimnasio, por ejemplo—, no te enteras de nada. Hasta el punto de tener que desactivarlos para poder continuar con la llamada. Es ridículo. La música se escucha perfectamente pero en la llamada, no sé qué desconfigurarán estos auriculares en el software, es imposible mantener una conversación. Y no es cuestión del teléfono: he probado en otros móviles y ocurre lo mismo. Es una lástima porque son cómodos y la batería dura razonablemente pero, si solo me sirven para escuchar música, me limita bastante.Lo dicho: los devolveré y probaré suerte con otros.

Bisher gefallen mir die Kopfhörer überraschend gut. Ich habe zuvor Apple AirPods benutzt, aber der Akku ist nach einigen Jahren Gebrauch inzwischen unbrauchbar.Sound ist natürlich nicht großartig, allerdings auf jeden Fall in Ordnung für den Preis. Bis heute habe ich keine Probleme mit der Verbindung feststellen können. Die Kopplung ging schnell und die Kopfhörer verbinden sich sofort mit meinem Smartphone. Der Akku scheint auch gemäß der Produktbeschreibung zu sein und die Case hat auch eine Menge Kapazität.Mir persönlich gefällt auch das (matt-)schwarze Design sehr und die Steuerung ist nach ein bisschen Eingewöhnung angenehm. Insgesamt sehr empfehlenswerte Budget-Option!

Ich bin von Anfang an begeistert. Ich habe schon mehrere andere BT-In-Ear-Kopfhörer! Alle haben Vor- und Nachteile. Die neuen jetzt sind in einem außergewöhnlichen kleinen Ladeköcher. Dieser aktiviert die Einsätze wenn man ihn öffnet. Das pairen funktioniert sehr einfach und schnell. Das herausnehmen ist das einzige, was mir sofort nicht gefällt. Die Einsätze sind zu glatt um sie einfach zu entnehmen. Bei Kälte und mit Handschuhen kaum lösbar! Das ist wirklich schlecht, ist aber auch bei anderen In-Ear-Einsätzen ähnlich schlecht. Der Ton gefällt, die Bedienfunktionen funktionieren auf Anhieb. Der Preis ist begeisternd! Wer gern mehr ausgeben möchte, soll es tun, es ist aber nicht notwendig. Absolute Kaufempfehlung!Ein Hit ist auch die Beschreibung bei Amazon. Besonders 5. der Aufzählung ist der Hit! LOLNach 4Tagen den ersten Kopfhörer verloren, da sich der Köcher geöffnet hatte....Pech.

Estoy encantada con estos auriculares. Los utilizo para llamadas de Teams, para escuchar música mientras trabajo, entreno o paseo. Me han ido tan bien que le compré otros a mi hijo. Un compañero del trabajo al ver me que me iban tan bien compró 2. Y otra compañera otro. Y mi padre se los acaba de comprar. No dejo nunca reseñas, mal por mi parte, pero es que hemos comprado tantos y todos tan contentos que se merecía que dedicará un ratito a escribir reseña. Referente a la batería los cargo una vez a la semana.

Wenn etwas gut ist - muss man es auch einfach mal sagen! Deshalb hier eine schnelle Rezension. Sohnemann brauchte dringend neue Kopfhörer, weil seine alten USB C Kabel-Hörer langsam den Geist aufgeben. Und da fiel die Wahl auf Grund der aktuellen „Taschengeldsituation“ auf die preislich ansprechenden Kopfhörer - auch daher, weil natürlich die Produktrezensionen wirklich gut sind! Was soll ich sagen - aus gutem Grund! Er ist absolut begeistert! Das Kopfhöreretui ist sehr solide verarbeitet (fast so schön wie bei Apple AirPods) und hat einen USB C Ladeeingang. LED auf der Vorderseite zeigt den Ladestatus an. Die Kopfhörer selber fühlen sich sehr gut an und die BT Verbindung dauert keine 5 Sekunden. Der Klang ist wirklich gut und solide. Für diesen Preis gibt es wirklich nichts auszusetzen. Batterie hält sehr lange. Absolute Kaufempfehlung!!

Nachdem ich mit ""preiswerten"" BT Kopfhörern jetzt mehrfach hintereinander schlechte bis sehr schlechte Erfahrungen gesammelt habe, war das mein letzter Versuch, es mit günstigen InEar Kopfhörern zu versuchen - es hat funktioniert. Ich setze sie erst seit 2 Tagen ein, dafür zum ""für alles"" - telefonieren, Hörbuch, Musik. Fazit bis jetzt: übertrifft meine Erwartungen. Die Haptik ist sehr angenehm, nicht das Gefühl, billige Ware in der Hand zu halten, sondern eine glatte, erhabene Oberfläche. Ich nutze bei weitem nicht alle Funktionen, wie Rufannahme oder Vor und zurück bei Musik, aber die Lautstärkeregelung war ein KO Kriterium, um nicht jedes mal das Telefon aus Tasche kramen zu müssen. Funktioniert reibungslos. Telefon in der Tasche - BT Verbindung hat manchmal ganz kurze Aussetzer, was auch an meinem Telefon liegen kann, beim Telefonieren mit dem Handy auf dem Tisch vor mir -> klarer Klang, sehr gute Verbindung, keine Abbrüche. Ich hoffe, es bleibt so! :-)

Telefonieren geht gut,  Bluetooth koppelt sich verlässlich. Hatte beim 1. Mal eine ""Montagsversion"", die einen der Kopfhörer nicht lud, der motivierte Kundenservice hat mir aber dann ein neues Set zugesendet, mit dem alles in Ordnung ist.

Consigliatissime soprattutto per la comodità notevole (sono le prime cuffie senza archetto che riesco ad utilizzare per svariate ore di seguito senza che mi diano fastidio le orecchie), ma anche per la batteria: le ho da circa un mese e le ho utilizzate per molte ore per ascoltare musica e le ho caricate solamente appena ricevute! 👀❤️ Sono complete di istruzioni in molte lingue, incluso l'italiano, e hanno molte funzioni comode quando si è indaffarati, per cambiare traccia musicale, alzare o abbassare il volume o rispondere a telefonate solamente toccandole (diversi tipi di tocchi, in base a cosa si debba fare). La qualità del suono è ottima, le ho usate anche per camminare a fianco di una strada molto trafficata e posso confermare che anche l'eliminazione del rumore esterno mi ha molto stupito positivamente, credo siano le cuffie migliori che ho avuto finora. Insomma: secondo me per questa cifra è un affare, le consiglio per utilizzo personale o come regalo, secondo me hanno ben poco da invidiare a quelle molto più costose e esteticamente molto simili.

Estoy muy contenta con estos auriculares, son bonitos, muy cómodos pues no sé mueven de la oreja, el sonido es bueno. El  auricular izquierdo dejo de funcionar a los pocos días de estrenarlo pero el servicio de atención al cliente es magnífico, me enviaron otros sin ningún coste y estos si los llevo usando un tiempo y no he tenido ningún problema con ellos, funcionan perfectamente.

Forse non hanno un suono da audiofili, ma per quello che costano, le ho pagate 19.99 euro, vanno più che bene. le uso prevalentemente per guardare video da tablet e computer. le ho anche provate su iPhone per telefonare ed in condizioni non particolarmente difficili chi mi ascoltava dall'altra parte mi ha detto che la qualità del suono proveniente dai microfoni incorporati nei miei auricolari era nella media. Ottima la durata della batteria, almeno per l'uso medio che ne faccio. Queste le prime impressioni dopo una settimana di utilizzo. mi riservo di fare eventuali aggiornamenti in seguito.

Para escuchar música están bien, la calidad del sonido no es la mejor pero por el precio no está nada mal, le hace falta calidad en los bajos. La batería también duraba bastante.Para llamadas fatal, estuve probando con varias personas y no me escuchaban, enviaba audios por whatsapp y tampoco se escuchaba. Tanto si estás haciendo una llamada en interior como exterior el micrófono es bastante malo.Los devolveré :(

Provati tutti i giorni. Per ascoltare la musica vanno bene. I controlli touch sono troppo sensibili e tendono ad attivarsi da soli se tenuti in tasca. Dopo un tot di ore non funzionano più anche se la batteria è quasi del tutto carica. Per le chiamate non sono buoni. Se ne uso uno alla volta il microfono non è sufficiente a far sentire la voce all'altra persona. Le chiamate in ascolto hanno un volume troppo basso e non si possono aumentare. Sono tentato di restiturli.

Hace unas semanas comenté que mis auriculares no funcionaban después de varias semanas de uso..El vendedor se puso en contacto conmigo, y después de hablarlo me los ha repuesto por unos nuevos..Valoro mucho su trato tan atento y su servicio post venta excelente! .así que he cambiado la reseña...Un producto puede salir defectuoso y ahí también se valora la calidad de respuesta y profesionalidad del vendedor..Muchas gracias

Se oyen maravillosamente, la batería les dura muchísimo (aunque de ponerle una pega, diría que no sabes cuando se le va a acabar a la cajita. Los audífonos si, porque el propio dispositivo donde lo conectes, te pone el % de batería que tienen). Son muy cómodos de llevar. Sin duda, una buena compra.

Comodísimos, lo que mas me gusta es el diseño que tienen, muy moderno, cómodo y ligero. Los controles táctiles son sorprendentemente útiles y funcionan muy bien.La calidad de sonido es bastante decente teniendo en cuenta el precio, no puedes esperar una calidad increíble pero hacen su trabajo mucho mejor que cualquier auricular true wireless de su gama.Pese a no tener el típico diseño deportivo, se sujetan bastante bien, así que también los veo útiles para hacer ejercicio.¡¡Super recomendado!!

Me ha sorprendido lo pequeños que son. Soy una persona que todos los cascos se me caen pero tengo q decir que estos me han gustado muchos (ni saltando se me caen). Suenan súper fuerte (tengo q poner el volumen a la mitad que si no me voy a quedar sorda. Conectarlos al móvil es de lo más fácil. Los botones de los auriculares funcionan bien.Ahora sí la batería todavía no los he probado mucho tiempo pero teniendo en cuenta que la caja los carga, espero tener fe.Comprarlo.

Die Teile sitzen gut im Ohr, wenn man den Dreh raus hat. Koppeln mit Google Pixel 4a klappte nach vollständigem Aufladen problemlos (lediglich vorgeladen ging es nicht), die Verbindung bleibt dann auch stabil. Das Problem ist das Klangbild, bei dem die Plugs gegenüber kabelgebundenen Geräten stark abfallen. Musikhören geht noch, wenn man sich klarmacht, dass in der Preisklasse natürlich keine High End-Offenbarung zu erwarten ist. Aber beim Telefonieren sowohl im Freien wie in Innenräumen wird es ärgerlich. Die eigene Stimme kommt auch bei sonst stiller Umgebung nur dumpf, schwammig und teils unverständlich rüber, schlechter als bei eingeschalteter Freisprechfunktion, die man aus einiger Entfernung ohne Kopfhörer nutzt. Schade - damit ist diese vermeintlich ""günstig"" erworbene Anschaffung für mich praktisch unbrauchbar. Ich suche weiter.

Edito: he logrado que vuelva a cargar el auricular y ahora mismo funciona. Esperaré algo más de tiempo a ver si se mantiene.Estaba contenta con las prestaciones que ofrecían estos auriculares. Teniendo en cuenta que no son de alta gama, su uso para podcast, que es mi caso, cumplía perfectamente. Pero ya no funciona, ni carga el auricular izq, por lo que no volvería a comprarlos ni los recomiendo.
